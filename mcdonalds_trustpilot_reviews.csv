5,"The serving of chicken meal is now larger, compared to previous months. Coke float, hamburger, and Hot Fudge sundae tastes great too!"
5,"Place was clean, which isn’t always the case with busy locations. Solid spot for a quick meal on the go."
1,"Placed my order at 5:33am through your app. When I got there they said we are closed with no manager. I said I already paid through your app. He said I can't help you with that. When the manager came in she said it will take a while to get things started. I said I will wait. are a few minutes the manager asked me to pull up and she would bring out my order. They brought out 2 different orders none of which was mine.  I waited and waited, and my order came out at 6:15am. The employee asked me to leave the drive through area or they will call the police. I had asked for a receipt, and no one came out with my receipt. I went inside and asked for a receipt and the manager ignored me. I finally had to ask an employee to print me a receipt. I was finally able to leave with my order at 6:30am. I would not recommend this location to anyone. Why would anyone wait about an hour to have my order completed????"
5,"I liked the chips better than the burger... however, all of em tasted great!"
1,"Ugh, I asked for extra pickles and they gave me one… like girl math says that’s actually negative pickles."
5,"Macdonald's is always a reliable choice when you want quick ,tasty food and a good price.The service is usually fast ,the staff are friendly and the restaurants are clean and confortable and the menu has something for everyone from classic Burgers a d fries to New seasonal items."
4,Their movie-themed floats were refreshing but the flavors are not that unique compared to other drinks. I wished a wider variety of flavors next time.
3,"This branch in Richmond, VA was decent. The food came out hot and the order was correct. The wait time was a little longer than expected, but overall it was an average experience."
5,"services Differ From Place To Place, but geenrally its good food."
1,"I had to put a star but trust me they don’t deserve it. The store on WALES RD. In JACKSON OHIO, is by far the worst McDonald’s that has ever opened their doors and is stocked full of the most uneducated, unhygienic, rudest dirtiest slowest members of society that call themselves employees. This place needs to shut down like ASAP and never ever try to reopen again. I have personally NEVER had ONE good experience here not ONE"
1,"Bad food, bad taste and employees are unfriendly especially in my area. I recommend other fast-food dining restaurants..."
1,If you want to pay for an order and not receive all you paid for only to be fobbed of and gaslighted by staff by all means use the ryde branch if you want on brand service go to Newport
5,My favorite place to get dinner after midnight.
1,They dont have shakes over 90% of the time. It is really ridicules
1,today I was double billed on one single order that was all  wrong and when I contacted them they are refusing to give me one of the refunds stating they cant well you had no problem taking two one for 23 and one for 17 I hope other people read this and be careful double check your accounts and make sure they dont take more than the order should be
3,The food was cold the employees was nasty and hateful never have a kind word to say.
5,I think McDonald is an incredible place to eat delicious and cheap because it have a good prices and the quality is ok.I recommend McDonald’s💗
4,"For me, the service is good; it's fast, efficient, and has excellent prices. The burgers and fries are delicious, as are the desserts. I'd like to see security in the restaurants. They have many locations, and the food tastes very similar."
1,"We went to the McDonald’s in zanesville ohio.  The staff was so inappropriate  and curing at each other, saying the f word.  It took us 40 min to get our food, if the worker would have just stopped complained and eating then she could have moved the customers along.  Also, my friend asked about her med fries she order ( only thing ordered) asked since her number disappearedThe worker got her fries in a bag and threw them at my disabled friend.Then she said once I get this lobby cleared I’m closing up and quitting."
1,"Absolutely disgusting the food was freezing when it was delivered, you could tell this must have been sat on a hot plate/under a crappy heat lamp, it would have been under that long that it made the food rubbery - we could’t eat it and tried the dog with the food and he wouldn’t go anywhere near it !! McDonald’s I don’t know why you bother to offer delivery of food, especially if you can’t keep it warm/fresh for your customers - you should be ashamed - my delivery times changed a few times and was kept getting put back - makes you wonder if that food had been sat a hell of a long time !!! I won’t be ordering or bother going to one of your establishments again !!Ryhope McDonald’s"
1,"McDonald’s staff employe namesFemale:AmyMale:AustinBe carful when ordering plain hamburgers there not plain hamburgers the put bits of onion in there and don’t tell youLocation: Gate Leisure Park, Terminus Rd, Chichester PO19 8EL"
1,I went to US for my business expansion and visited a mcdonalds closby to my motel. Food was too much pricey than in my hometown and tastes too much bad for my palette. Japans mcdonalds is much better. Mcdonalds need to improve their service and taste
1,"I went into their store at 5130 n Sheridan Road in Chicago on June 7th at 853p to purchase their $6.00 meal deal on their app. It was rung up at $7 and tax. Total of $7.76. It was shown on their board as $6.00 too not including tax. When i brought up to honor the $6.00 price i was refused by the cashier and the man they sent over when I asked to speak to the manager. It was only the matter of a dollar but I was treated like I was the one at fault and treated poorly. Besides McDonald's makes zillions of dollars dont they? I'm also a disabled senior. When I called their corporate office the young kid on the phone treated me poorly as well. He said they issued you a refund didn't they? I said for the whole meal not the dollar difference. Besides I demanded it because they refused to honor the $6.00 price. Also, the kid in corporate on my call to them acted as if they did me a big favor and gave me food for free or something. As i said i was refunded what they charged me for it which was a dollar more than on on their app which was lower. Also he added now i know why you were treated like that. Honest thats the absolute truth! Also i feel discrimination at the store and on the call. Thats how they settled it. I was told they would pass it along to the store manager. Thats all. I was told that it was to be passed on to the stores manager. It was not settled by mcdonalds corporate office. I requested a gift card for my trouble and I was refused that. Also the credit at my bank is showing at zero dollars. I need to contact me bank after I submit this. Additional thoughts their food wasn't any good in the first place. Most of the time it is served warm. Also too expensive now for what is given. Not pleasing to my eyes. From now on I refuse to go to any mcdonalds again. There is a circle k and marianos close by and when im looking to pick up something I will go there for a quick bite. Again that restaurant and McDonald's corporate doesn't care about their customers as I see. Many reputable companies would treat this in a matter which would show they care about their customers. McDonald's corporate doesn't care period. Also the customer service rep was also very rude and kept interrupting me when I spoke. Repeating that I already told him something when I didn't. Goodbye McDonald's with your corporate greed! Also apparently want to rip people off and scam the public as indicated here by over charging the customers."
5,"McDonald’s is the best. The app and the discounts really help. I saved $7 while using the McDonalds app. I literally only order through the app from now on. Great food, great people."
1,"No matter where in the world why do people still eat mc Donald's it's fake and poisonous, I mean dang how hungry are you!!!!! High prices disgusting food and now it looks like a gray jail!!!! I haven't eaten there for years and I'm very cautious of other establishment s too especially taco bell 🤮 and the date is a date of my review not experience"
1,"The is the worst mcdonalds I have been to. 70345 Hwy 21 Covington, LA 70433. They gave me an uncooked sandwich that was cold with stale bread. You go inside the business and understand why right away. Just left with no food and money gone. I will never return to this sorry dump."
1,El Mac Donald de levittown el servicio es extremadamente lento y pesimo
1,"I have stopped at the Hwy 82, Greenville, MS location several times and have yet to get my order of a Diet Coke correct.  Today's flavor tasted like Dr. Pepper.  If someone orders a diet anything just maybe they are diabetic and can't drink sugar drinks!  Today they also decided I was not deserving of cheese on my sausage, egg AND CHEESE biscuit.  This is truly getting ridiculous.  If the people of Greenville would boycott these ""fast food"" restaurants I bet the powers that be would do something about the laziness and don't care attitudes their employees have!  Needless to say today was my last trip to any McDonalds.  I will make my own breakfast, at least that way I will get what I want!"
1,"I visited several time to the Mcdonald's on rt33 Mercerville NJ, the manager a spanish guy is miserable he doesn't look at you or say good morning or hello. But to me one of the most important this is he is not veteran friendly he makes faces and click his tongue when ask and prove that you'll a veteran. Why is he working there??? Without the veterans he wouldn't even have a job! While he was sleeping in a warm bed I was fighting in war for his freedom and our country's freedom! GOD BLESS THE USA!"
3,"In my opinion its not bad at all, but there are some things that should be improved, mostly meat quality is going down from what I see"
4,My family friends loves the chicken nuggets and french fries!!!
1,McDonald's food is cancerous. Mice won't eat it. Sit out for four years and still looks a day old. McDonald's food will put you in your grave after you suffer really bad cancer  before their food puts you in the graveyard after a long painful time. McDonald's should be permanently closed for poisoning people.
1,"Ondara McDonalds.I really fancied a burger and the queue at Burger King was too big for my hunger. So i thought i'd try MacDonalds.. which had no queue.. zero queue.Now i know why. What a shameful excuse of a burger, with ignorant staff and crap food. No wonder Burger King is trouncing you! I wasted 12quid and had to get a burger king on the way home to get the taste of macdonalds out my mouth! Ideally you should give a refund. But you're too shameful to do that of course."
5,McDonald’s has always done right by me. Love all the new options that are on the menu recently
1,"I wanted my 3 cookies :(edit: it was a mistake ordering directly through the app, it's impossible to get help on any issues."
3,So I'm a regular at hieneberg drive mcdonald's cause I live so close n usually I don't complain about them n there's alot I could say but being a regular n always getting the same thing I kinda kno what I can get by now but tonight I ask for Mac sauce for 2 ppl I legit got a quarter size amount in a chicken nugget box I look at it he looks at me and says that's all we have like nooooooooooo first off your mcdonald's your not out of Mac sauce from beginning when I asked he seemed aggravated n it seemed like I purposely got a small amount n then wouldn't give me more n tries to say there out of freaking Mac sauce.......I don't complain about the crazy wait times or the employees just staring at you walking by instead of saying I'll be with on a min or can I take your order I don't ever complain but today pissed me right off as a loyal customer
1,"Bellies Hill roundabout Lanarkshire, Scotland McDonalds restaurant at 15:00 on Friday 18/04/2025, I visited this place with wife, son and a friend, on entering the restaurant there was food and serviettes strewn across the floor and on tables. We ordered ( my wife and I had just driven up from Yorkshire). I asked at the counter for some one to clean table number 8 which she cleaned however ignoring the food on floor and other tables.As I suffer from a bowel problem I went to the toilet which was rammed with lots of human waste and toilet tissue. I informed the cleaner who said he would sort it. He started cleaning the restaurant and as I had checked my watch when I informed him it was 15:15 at 15:45 I went back to the toilet only to find it in the same disgusting filthy state. This time I went to the counter to see the manager who completely ignored me when the young lady told him that I wished to see him. FIVE minutes later I had to call across the counter that I wished to speak to him. I reported the situation to him and he completely ignored me. I am now (as a fully qualified Health and Safety person am seriously considering reporting this to the local environmental health office.S. Balmer"
1,For McDonalds on Montano Albuquerque NM. Went there to order a happy meal for my granddaughter. No onions the smart ass who prepared the meal put about a half cup of onions on the burger. Who does that to a child?
2,"visited restaurant in fort lauterdale and fries were super cold and stale, not a great experience and expect higher quality from mcdonalds"
1,McDonalds warwick Blvd near CNU in Newport News. Eggs nearly hurned. Reminder to check your food in the drive thru before you pull away.
1,"Went to McDonald's Ryde Isle of Wight this afternoon.Nice burgers, but fries were awful, they wererope'y, even the birds won't eat them.Next time I visit McDonald's I will skip thefries and just order burgers and drinks etc."
1,I run asleep don't think that McDonald's even reserves a star because of the fact that they are grinding up humans I mean I don't even produce as much cows as they're producing an hamburger it might not even be real we could be eating people not thinking about that I haven't ate fast food and over a year and a chicken sandwich the other day and threw a ride up so my body doesn't even want that s*** I don't judge anyone that likes McDonald's me I just can't do it nasty
1,"I rarely go to McDonalds, but happened to visit the Portsmouth North Harbour outlet on 14/01/2025 where there was a 20 minute wait, kiosk machines not working properly and giving no receipts. When the food finally arrived it was cold, and the milkshakes contaminated with multiple flavours. Complained to McDonalds Customer Services who initially tried to ignore the complaint because I didn't have a receipt, even though their machines had run out of till roll. I was eventually given a QR code to redeem a free meal as compensation which I tried to claim at the McDonald's in Southampton West Quay Retail Park on 31/03/2025. Once again, multiple kiosks not working and all had run out of till roll so no receipts. The kiosk wouldn't accept the QR code to redeem my free meal, so I waited a the front counter for over 10 minutes, being repeatedly ignored by multiple staff members, until I eventually walked out in frustration (and without my meal). Completely disgraceful company, I will be avoiding McDonald's at all costs. The fact that none of their Trustpilot profiles have been claimed and the sheer number of negative reviews tells you everything.I'm not lovin' it."
1,"I went to McDonalds, and I ordered a hamburger with pickles. Instead, they gave me a mc double with cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, and ketchup. There weren't even pickles on the hamburger. I also ordered a cheeseburger, and they did the same thing with the cheeseburger. Clearly this McDonalds doesn't listen to your orders very well. The McDonalds was in Livermore on Vasco Road. If this continues with any other McDonalds, I will no longer buy from them."
3,The French fries taste better when cooked two darker colour than the pale white
1,If you’re not going to revamp the way the workers treat the customers you might as well shut down. We will get to a point of boycotting because it is getting absolutely ridiculous! The person taking your order in the drive through is disgusting and gives no apologies. Closes the door right in your face no thank you nothing pleasant at all. You cannot continue to write that off as being busy. Do you know why you’re busy? Because we are coming to spend our money!! I have dealt with an annoyed attitude for the last time at this McDonald’s.
1,"You know maccy d's was elite back in the day I feel like it became washed after a couple of bad years I mean people still eat there because its like a staple of fast food but let me tell you like the small fast-food restaurants that you can find are like 100% better and also wayyy cheaper, like for mcd you need to spend so much money and not even been filled up"
1,"WOULD BE 0 STARS IF I COULD!!! The store at 1900 N State Rd 7(441) Hollywood Fl. Is a joke! This is my 3rd complaint. Today was a DOOZIE! My breakfast bill was $6.51 I paid with a $20 so my change was $13.49, the cashier says here is $13.00 I do not have change ($.49) so I said so give me $1. Her reply was NO MY DRAWER WILL BE SHORT; WE HAVE NO CHANGE IN THE STORE! UMMMM excuse me I said as the customer that is not my problem I should not be shorted since your store is not prepared. I asked for the manager and of course her reply was ""I AM THE MANAGER"" she said hold on and slammed the drive thru window in my face....I waited like 3-4 minutes for her return to her to say ""HERE and shoved $.40 at me still $.09 short but that was fine. Then I get my food hash brown ice cold like wasn't even cooked and sausage McMuffin hard as a rock like it was sitting for 30+minutes. Why should I be punished since your store has no change??? KIARA was the ""managers"" name DO BETTER McDONALDS DO BETTER!!!!!! and still 9 hours later no call back from corporate about this situation. Now here is another scam the store at 5385 Hollywood Blvd in Hollywood is running through the drive thru since this is our other main store....be aware when you go to the drive thru they have started asking ""DO YOU WANT YOUR CHANGE???"" UMMM Heck Yeah, I Do why would I give it to you??? so at the end of the night you can have $100+ dollars McDonalds your employees are thief's and just plain RUDE....DO BETTER"
1,"Newmarket Road Cambridge UKMy Big Mac was awful.There was no sweet pickle relish.There was no yellow mustard.Paprika, onion ?It was just two meat pattys, cheese & huge amounts of lettuce (not in the recipe !!)"
1,Cheap chemicals don’t seem healthy or appealing at all. I feel very bad after eating this kind of food. Their employees also don’t appear healthy or happy.
1,I asked for a CHOCOLATE Milkshake and they gave a vanilla milkshake and this is the SECOND TIME!!!
4,"McDonald's is what it is. I'm not interested in reviewing them, I'm testing this site before I review another company."
1,"the worst service, unrespectful with the client and they make fun of the customers in their faces. terrible experience in mc donalds food court IBN batuta Dubai."
3,"Stopped by real quick to grab a McChicken. Took way longer than “fast” food should. Food was alright, nothing to write home about. The soda machine was down too, which was kinda annoying."
2,"McDonald's claims they use ""quality"" ingredients in their meals, but their fries have 14 ingredients (all preservatives) and their burgers used to have a PINK PASTE just so that they WOULDN'T USE AS MUCH MONEY!!!McDonald's tastes okay in 2025, I guess."
1,"Well people are Randomly arguing about inventory at Home Depot in Flagstaff Arizona, Seattle Washington and Portland Oregon? Also arguing Chemicals that are locked 🔐 up because of Huffing in Coconinio County 💊😶‍🌫️😢 Staff seam's to Randomly argue about electronics and Auto Parts and other businesses that have EBT overcharges? I talked to Jose that does not have stock or investments in the Circle of Page Food Bank and Margaret that has been to foreign countries 💺 about this situation 🗣️🥺"
1,everytime i come here i order a diet coke and they always give me normal coke when i order a diet coke i expect to get a diet coke
1,Big mistake firing their CEO for having a girlfreind who worked at Mcdonalds. Who the heck cares about that. Dont fire the guy. Where else is he supposed to meet people?New CEO came in a trippled prices. Now the stores are empty. I pulled all my stock out of Mcdonalds. They have lost their way. Cluless board of directors who fired the ceo. Poor leadership. Food makes you feel likw crap after eating it. For most people it doesnt make sense to go here whwn you can go to a local burger joint for the same price. Mcdonalds used to be fairly priced for what you get. Prices dont reflect inflation they are way higher than inflation.Customer service is worse than it was in past decardes. American workforce is notorius for being apathetic and that is what you get these days at Mcds. Bleached wheat flour also causes diabetes and it is in 80% of their food. Google it. I was a life long customer but will not go back there since their pirce gauging and new CEO. If they fire him and lower prices Id consider going back.
1,"My experience at McDonald's was a real disappointment. What disappointed me the most was the lack of cleanliness at the tables. I sat at a table that looked like it had not been cleaned, with leftover food and drink from previous customers.The table was dirty, and there was even ketchup that someone had left behind. I felt disgusted at having to sit at such a dirty table.Also, my mom had to clean the table, which I thought was horrible since that should be done by the staff. The overall lack of cleanliness made me feel like it wasn't worth going back to that place.All in all, my experience at McDonald's was very disappointing, and the lack of cleanliness at the tables was the worst. I hope they take steps to improve the cleanliness, Thank you."
1,"McDonald’s seriously needs to be shut down. This place is horrible and the food is old and disgusting and there apples slices are always expired but they sell them anyway! How disgusting is that?? The people they hire are very disrespectful and rude or they are on drugs and are too high to get your order right. I mean they can’t even make a plain cheeseburger to save their life and one time I ordered a mcchicken and they didn’t put the chicken on it!!! How do you forget the main ingredient, it’s literally the name of the sandwich ???!!!"
1,Whatever you do steer clear from the McDonalds on 47th and broadway in wichita. I went there tonight and had the worst experience ever. First I went in the store and placed my order by kiosk then when I get to the counter to pay I stood there for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me then when they finally did while in there eating I had to listen to 2 young guys and 1 of the managers having an intense conversation and every other word was a cuss word and they weren't being quiet about it either then I had to hear one of the guys tell a story about how a man came through the drive thru and was talking under his breath in the speaker so he screamed into the speaker calling that man a bastard! Really this is the type of people that McDonalds wants serving their customers?! Not only was it appalling but it was really irritating the lack of leadership that their so called manager had cause she wasn't even trying to correct those guys matter of fact she was joining in with all the cussing! So unprofessional and disturbing. And all while they were cussing their buttons off there was a young boy maybe 6 to 8 years old in there eating dinner with his dad he didn't need to hear all of that from them. So yeah if you want to actually enjoy your meal go to a different McDonalds because this one doesn't seem to care about customers and customer service. At least not good customer service.
1,Mcdonalds in Gandia. Dreadful food and dreadful service. :(
1,"Bassetts Pole UK ,sloppy service sloppy burger"
1,"Supports Fascists, Extremely Unhealthy,  Low Wages, Shitty Ice Cream Machine"
2,"Drove by a mcd's on 91st ave and peoria ave in peoria az.  Giant sign posted on side of building:  Drive through open 24 hours.  it's 3 in the am and I was hungry.  Pulled in upto the ordering speakers, waited 10 12 seconds no one acknowled I'm there.  After another 15 seconds  I started yelping at the speaker hello hello, anyone there?  Nothing. drove around past the empty pay window and stopped at the pick up window.  Saw a girl there who looked right at me, turned around and walked off.  Waited about 30 seconds, she never came back.There were employees outside around there cars.  Didn't see any of them in the building.I don't care what's going on, shift change, spilled grease, 2 in the bathrooms.  You don't leave customer hanging.  She should have stopped, come to the window, (she was 5 feet away) and give me whatever excuse you have, anything just acknowledge I'm there, and you're not open.  I was the only one there in the line."
1,"I hereby register my dissatisfaction with the service received at one of the McDonald's units. On January 29th, I was at the store located in Regi Budapest and was served by an employee with glasses and blond curly hair at the checkout who demonstrated an extreme lack of cordiality and professionalism. From the beginning of the interaction, the attendant appeared impatient and rude, not clarifying my doubts and treating me with inattention. Furthermore, his unfriendly attitude and lack of interest in providing good service compromised my experience at the restaurant. I understand that adverse situations can occur, but I believe that the quality of customer service should be a priority for a company the size of McDonald's."
5,"The cashier Manny was cool asf..he even went in his own pocket to help me out faster then i could ask ...friendly, polite, & non judgemental! And for the area of this location that means something to me..thank you"
1,"Never again! I went at 9:30 for breakfast.It look like it been cooked at 6:30 and sat in the warming tray as were stiff could use them as a frisbee disc. Hashbrowns were soggy sausage with stale flown it around too!Next time, I’ll just go to waffle House for some real food!!!"
1,"McDonald's used to be a reliable choice, but the quality and service have declined significantly. My recent visit was disappointing, food was lukewarm and the order was incorrect. It no longer feels like the fast and friendly experience it once was."
1,"For one, this food has been benefiting since they started deregulating the food industry. They've been killing Americans with crappy food and high prices. Now they bring in someone who actually is going to continue to deregulate s*** more and take credit for saving money. McDonald's is brought back a $5 meal to kill off more Americans again. Where is there any good towards making America healthier McDonald's go away"
1,"50 cents to use the loo, after luke warm 'hot drink' and ughy sickly cheese cake. Even Ryanair tried that scam and decided it was too much of a customer rip off. Experience at MacDonalds at main station in Vienna."
1,"My opinion is that there MAY have been a Taenia saginata in my burgerJust an opinion, not stating facts.Just an opinion, not stating facts.Just an opinion, not stating facts.This is not real, this is not a fact."
1,"You guys became WAY too expensive for a fast food chain. Enough of the corporate greed, the people need to eat!"
1,They are snitches. Don't buy there.
1,"The food quality has gone downhill. After the hamburger problem they had, they have started overcooking the burgers and smashing them so thin they barely hold together. I bet that the quarter pounder no longer starts out as a quarter pound of meat. Sad to see, will just push customers to the other competitors, has me….."
1,"Anyone that has ever been to a store already knows how poorly they run, but I had no idea the entire corporation was this bad! I have had orders screwed up and they offer no phone support, no email support, no message support and their online ap sucks. No where does it assist user with filing complaint ref wrong order given. They have fb page, also useless. No one ever responds from that too. Then I saw the other day, a store that had 2 drive through lanes. They take order from left lane. Then right lane, then left then right, etc. This seems stupid to me. And it doesn't make anything go faster,it's the same. Anyway I pull up,car in left lane, right was empty, I pull right. Then they took order the next 3 cars, all in left lane. I had to pull up and ask, is it broken on the right or what?! Worst corporation I've ever seen. Nothing runs correctly!!!"
4,I actually like the app & the deals they have & building points for a free item. Best coffee around too.
1,"Way too expensive for what it is, not worth your money, their burger meat is dry and too small, you can make your own burger better at home."
4,Last time I have visited in Lahore Pakistan. The food was too much yummy and I m give 4stars bcz service was not good.
3,Not bad food considering it's fast food take-out. Would like to see them improve the burgers.
1,Arrived Sunday 11/24/2024 @ 9:06 am. Worker acknowledged my presence and went to back of store. At 9:15 I left since there was no interest in taking my order or providing any service to me.  This is at the store located at 10431 Page Ave Overland MO
1,"Been here 100+ times, but takes only 1 time to leave a bad review. After spending 2h in mcdonalds and having 3 receipts, got fine for parking at mcdonalds for too long. Funny enough i was only customer there, it was between 10pm - midnight."
1,"Your location at 3425 Lansing Ave, Jackson, MI 49201 is an absolute disgrace. I've tried giving them multiple chances but each and every time, the nuggets are cold and dried out; completely inedible so I end up throwing them away. The burgers are a mess with shriveled, cold patties. I can't trust that the food is prepared in a sanitary way either. It doesn't matter if you're friendly and patient with them. It's blatant disrespect they hand out this slop. They know it's bad and they don't care. I've developed a disgust for your entire franchise since poor quality food and service is found at nearly every location."
1,Family member got e-coli from their burger.
1,10 nuggets and one effing honey with no other sauce no wonder I hate your establishment
5,"yes, very good and delightful."
1,"what are these employees i just orderd a burger they just rolled there eyes and they pretend i was a impatiant person i ate a burger when i was done i threw up over and over again i had nausea i quickly went to the same mcdonalds and they kicked me out when i was ok again i went inside the mcdonalds they told me to leave AGAIN! i  told them no they said ""i will call the police"" MF I WAS POISONED BY THESE MF EMPLOYEES if anything i should call the police!!! i just left after some hours ago i went to the same mcdonalds without even knowing and they were mad they were screaming then i realized I WAS AT THE SAME MCDONALDS they kept screaming at me i then left there is something wrong with them"
1,"They literally put feces in my cheeseburger, along with lidocaine. They were waiting for me because I was a big fan of McDonald's at the time. As I ate the feces and lidocaine laced cheeseburger, dozens of locals swarmed around me taunting ""you need to see a dentist"" and “you just ate s@$t""."
3,"The nuggets aren't tasty when you order them plain, the BBQ sauce just makes them taste better. But the McFlurries are very good, doesn't matter which one you get. Although I like both Oreos and M&M's. I hear McDonald's had an outbreak where people get sick from eating the Quarter Pounder due to the onions, now it's back with no onions? I still have a feeling the Quarter Pounder has E. Coli in the meat..."
1,"Cold food, missing items and unable to resolve through the virtual assistant which says contact the restaurant or Uber - both of which are impossible to do (there is no order on Uber and the restaurant phone mail box is full and no-one answering)Pity can't give 0 stars here"
1,"Got food worth of $32 the french fries was a stick of Cold  dry oil had to go to the garbage. The fish sandwich, the fish is dry hard on the edges. The cheese looks like dry cardboard, and the band was hard and cold. Chicken nuggets was OK. Happy meal the hamburger look like brown piece of cheese and the bun dry cold and stuck to the hamburger disgusting and suspending $32, do not eat at the McDonald’s route 66 Neptune, New Jersey continuously bad food"
1,McDonald's is not bad.  My problem with it though is that it is SO unhealthy.  They use mutant chickens to make their mcnuggets!
1,this is not the first time we ate in mcdonalds cardiff ferry road.first visited in mc donalds we have our cat inside our bag but no one told us the cat is not allowd inside even the cat is inside the bag.today we came there again one lady came to us and sayong why did we bring the cat inside and saying put under the table and we said ok . but the lady she is still not happy she come to the worker of mcdo and complain us in a minute 1lady who works in mcdo came to us and saying cat is not allowd even inside the bag when you finish please take him away this what she said ofcourse i need to take with me this our cat and spend a lot of money for this cat  and my cat is very clean he showered everyday .but before we came in we had a look if there is any sign that we cant take him in but nothing any sign. .anyway if is not allowd we will not do it again but how they approach us is not in a good way . also their hot chocolate is just like a boiled water only tasteless. 1star for mc do and never will eat  or order again.and put sign if is the cat inside the bag is not allowd because we dont know your rule. and im standing infront of the counter bar the lady i think its the manager asking are u waiting for ur food? then why i should i stand there? of course for food that i ordered and paid .
5,"I recently visited McDonald’s, and I had a fantastic experience! The service was quick and friendly, making my visit enjoyable from start to finish. I ordered the classic Big Mac meal, and it was delicious—perfectly cooked with all the classic flavors I love.The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, which added to the overall positive experience. I also appreciated the variety of menu options available, from their iconic burgers to healthier choices like salads and fruit.What stood out the most was the efficiency of the staff. My order was ready in no time, and they even checked to make sure everything was correct. It's great to see such commitment to customer service!Overall, I highly recommend McDonald’s for a satisfying meal at a great value. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a full meal, you can always count on McDonald’s to deliver!"

1,"Ordered breakfast as a treat from Dearne Valley McDonalds after paying the extra for faster delivery, it was late cold and burnt ! Never again!!"
2,boycott this product
3,"Burgers and fries are the same as everywhere in Mc Donald's, but prices in Georgia are way more high than in Russia, for example. However, they have a special bonus program thal allows me to accumulate my bonus points for each purchase and get some discount later. The annoying thing is that every time I order, my order number disappears from the display shortly, or it appears on the ""ready"" side when actually it's not ready. It disappears even from there too! What a nonsence.. I have to stay there at the desk and wait until it gets done. I also have to ask staff about my order and they always say kinda ""wait a bit, please"". This is weird.. Always! It's the second reason for rating it lower."
5,I had bought tea through the drive through on the mobile app. We were told to pull up and they would bring it to me soon. My wife and I waited and waited and waited. Finally I went in to find out if we had been forgotten. No. They were making it. After waiting I asked to see the manager. She informed me they were making it. After a time (twenty minutes) one of the line workers came to the front and told her it was broken and couldn't be fixed till the next day. They had no other beverages to offer as the carbonation didn't work on the sodas also. Now you might be saying. You rated them five? Well I contacted the store owner who made it right by giving my wife and I vouchers to get drinks. Yes all I wanted was what I paid for. He said he would address his staff. Management didn't just ignore. That's good business.
1,"Went thru the drive thur on 09/04/2024 ant 9:36 am order #1457, there was no “hello thank you for choosing McDonalds may I help you “? No it was “what do you want” I was shocked wow so rude. I thought good thing I’m not your manager because you sure would be trained better! But on a better note they did get my order right for a change. McDonald’s do better at training your employees with customer interaction attitudes."
1,"TerribleWe ordered 1 cheeseburger,fries nothing else,waited over 30 minutes, two people came in ordered a big Mac and fries,he got his ate it left.Were still waiting he ask,oh were busy a no bc we are the only ones inside."
1,Very bad service. Dry food without lettuce and tomato inside.
1,McDonald’s do not even bother going there if your from out of town late at . The are garbage lazy and will not take your order they will lock all the doors and do absolutely nothing. The worst place ever don’t go . McDonald’s down town Dallas. You will regret it
1,i wish there was an option for 0 star because this is truly a terrible nightmare. i am talking specifically about the cairo nasr city mcdonlds the chicken is dry asf and it tastes like rolled up toilet paper the bread is even worse its like its been out and dried on the counter for days it tasted older than me. i am  describing McChicken medium meal after i ate it i completely switched my life and even started heavy detoxing because of how motherfuckin dry and deadly that f*ckin meal was i cried and asked my self is this really what ive come to eating a f*ckin McChicken honestly only some will understand but u cant eat McDonalds and win in life that shi is for the weak fat ugly dugly fckers and not for the baddies like me i swear to god im never putting anything from mcdonlads in my mouth ever again this is honeslty enough to describe my rage im never that bothered to write a review but this really triggered me that meal was straight from someones ass hole istg.
1,"3835 East Loop 1604 North, Converse, TX 78109(210) 666-6565Open 24 hours  More hours  servicesA complaint I been fuming over for a good while now but first i'd like to explain I am a continued customer because like millions of others, I do enjoy Mcdonalds foodAt the address above I put in an order thru doordash. Doordash delivers the ""sealed"" bag of my order. I find I am missing a 10 piece nugget and the fries were not quite done.  Mcdonalds policy is call Doordash and get credit or refund.  Instead I made the 6 mile drive one way because I did not want a refund or credit, I wanted my food as it was ordered for a reason.  The manager, I did not ask her name but was right about 4:15 pm when i was there, was professional for the most part and gave me the missing nuggets and replaced my fries.  She also told me calling doordash was policy and to do that next time. I asked her how is it doordashes fault when its Mc'donald not putting the food in the bags. She just looked at me and said have a good say which is annoying management can't even give an answer. They think everyone's out for free food and that just crap!McDonald's bags and seals them shut and sets them in place to be picked up.  Doordashers cant even inspect to see if everything has been bagged because it's ""already sealed shut"".  It makes no sense to me how that can even be policy.It gets very frustrating, no matter how minor or how big the mistakes are in deliveries but I kid you not 9/10 they are wrong.  Don;t go by numbers and stats cuz we all know a crap ton of people dont bother with complaining just like me for years.A suggestion for all fast foods would be to put someone on quality inspection, inspection every bag before it gets sealed for delivery.  I bet this would go a long ways for keeping customers happy.  But it is NOT a delivery services fault and I hope you all see the flaw in this policy!this needs changing..........Have a question or feedback about a delivery order? First, check the Vendor Name to identify whether Uber Eats, DoorDash or Grubhub was handling your order, and please contact Uber Eats at: 1-866-987-3744, DoorDash at: 1-833-510-0332 or Grubhub at: 877-866-4482.

1,I did a take out order number 281 for 1 Hotcakes and Sausage and 1 Big Brk w/HC and 1 Hash Brown which is on the receipt i was given from Front Counter Side1 8/24/2024 08:20 AM. at the Cortez Rd location in Bradenton Florida .   When I got home and took the order out of the bag. I was not given the sausage I asked for and that I paid for that was on my receipt.   I was not going back due to the incompetence of your staff.  It is obvious that they do not verify the order from the ticket they have from what the customer ordered or they just don't care!!  I am very disappointed and will not be returning.  This issue has been posted on all social media sites.  Your staff needs to be trained on all aspects of customer service because I am sure I am not the only one who has received an incorrect order!  VERY POOR SERVICE
1,The store (#12354) used to be the best McDonalds I had been to. Now it is the worst. The people are rude. The past two times we ate there we had to wait more than fifteen minutes. The employees never say thank you...have a nice day...etc. My grand sons like the food but we will be going out of our way to go to a different location.
3,Typically a good experience here at my local mcdonalds. They are consistent and you know what to expect. Prices are getting kinda high now
5,Reichel you are the best la mejor sin coñas te queremos
1,"PSA: unless you like someone arguing with you or being rude to you, making your child cry, or if you enjoy your food coughed on…avoid McDonalds on Missouri Avenue and Jasper street. The manager Jose, is the one that is causing issues.This is now the 6th issue we have had. We are no longer giving this McDonald’s our business. It started out as just him being curt, (which I chalked up to we all have a rough day, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt); escalated to staff calling me crazy lady because I counted my change wrong and missed giving them a nickel (she said it on the microphone to other employees in Spanish; I speak Spanish by the way!); escalated to him and staff being rude and laughing (making us question the safety of the food); escalated to him arguing with my child until she was crying over a cup she wanted to buy; escalated to him sneezing and coughing all over the equipment he used to ring upthe order in the drive thru, then laughing with a staff member as I drove away. I actually had said bless you and I’m sorry you have to work while you are sick? He said, “they don’t care”. I said your manager makes you work while sick and he began laughing. I actually have safety and harassment concerns at this point because I called the store to complain to his manager and he refused to give me any information, other than he is the manager. He used the caller id to call me back without my consent, and began arguing with me. I have also seen him walk past my house on several occasions. I have reported to corporate but am now afraid of retaliation! Please be careful and stay away from this. Location. Store number 6665. 1590 Missouri Ave Largo FL!"

1,"Payson McDonald’s advertise 5 dollar menus or western quarter pound burger in windows n at drive thrue then won’t even honor it,the manager was rude and would not take my order so I went elsewhere n will not go back"
1,"A year ago, just when I thought I had experienced the absolute worst #1 big mac meal! The actual namesake of the company at the store 9841 Atlantic Blvd in Jacksonville, FL 32225 they have has found a more disappoint way serve an even more discussing Big Mac meal. Stale bread, rotting lettuce and the smell of this sandwich is so bad that a starving dog would walk away from it. The sad thing is there was a Culverts just around the corner! Aways so much better food there.  I   M u s t   H a v e   L o s t   M y   M i n d ! ! ! Never Again, Never Again, Never Again Mc Donalds franchise owner you should be ashamed of yourself this is so sad, sad, sad and as I leave the drive through and look to my left the windows to the lobby are so filthy you could not even see inside."
1,"If I could do no stars at all , I would.Do not ever go to 6401 Camp Bowie Boulevard. They no longer provide face to face customer service. When you walk in you need to catch someone, be aware if their running out to give food to drive thru they won’t stop to help you. Your chances of someone helping you is probably bother a worker who’s seating down taking their break. Because other than them, you won’t see anyone around. Once someone makes eye contact with you they just point at the kiosk thing and say you can order their, I explained that I have my children with me and can’t exactly pay attention to what I’m clicking and I need specific plain burgers etc. and they make you wait more so they can go do drive thru first. So I went to the drive thru instead and pull to the side to make sure I get what I ordered. Good thing I did because they didn’t give me any ketchup and was missing an order. After 45minutes of b***. Still no apology after I never gave them a fight. So here I am letting people know how sh** they can be now."
1,"this has to be the worst food place ever, i found a real cooked mouse in my burger, i almost ate it, people should go to 3.14 in Terre haute indiana, That restaurant is better"
1,Now their burger quality is very low. Plus you have to wait for a long time. I don't recommend McDonald's anymore.
1,"I did ordered 1 Big Mac, 3 cheeseburger and a small French fries.What I did got is a Big Mac , a French fries and 3 Fish-o filet."
1,"Had the unfortunate pleasure of buying food at the McDonald's at 8280 N. Wickham Rd. Melbourne Florida 32940. Cold nasty food. Steer clear from this slop factory!!!!The owner Rodriguez was actually there at the store when I went to get a refund and I can see why they're garbage !!!!, she seemed like a very classless condescending low life !!!"
1,Order at Kiosk and there is no receipt paper and hand sanitizer is out at all stalls.  Order number is called and placed on counter before I could ask for my cup which is never given when order is placed.  Finally get someone's attention (the front of the store is not manned by anyone.  This is a big no no in food retail.) and they get my cup.  Go to drink area and it is filthy.  No lids for medium or large drinks  Tables are filthy as well.  Seems like the only attention the employees pay is to the drive thru.  There was one employee sitting in the lobby on break I guess.  When I worked at McDonald's you did not take your break until the dining room was at least in a presentable order.  These three McDonald's in Kinston haven't been good for a long time but have gone down even more since the new owners have taken over.  Comments and complaints to them always go unanswered.
1,Terrible service.  Took 40 minutes for a small order. 2 people ahead of me left without there food!
1,"Eating at McDonald's has never made me so disappointed, and unfortunately, I am not only referring to the slow service and gross food.Nashville has a huge problem that isn't a very popular or well-liked topic: the amount of people who are stranded on the streets is overwhelming. Worse is the fact that this huge, bustling, tourist-riden city fails to provide the bare minimum amount of resources and services for those of us who are bound by these unimaginable circumstances.See, it became clear to me as I stood in line at this McDonald's: This city is more concerned with the appearance of their McDonald's restroom than to allow equal rights to all who reside here. We are all not granted the ability to use the same public facilities when nature calls - as it does for us all, no matter how much money we have, what we look like, or where we come from.It's 2024, and the restrooms are still segregated...I would go on into more explicit details, but I think you can all grasp the point I am making.It showed me something beautiful in the midst of such terrible discrimination, sadness, and mistreatment.We are no longer living in times of slavery, Hitler, or sexcism.We are in the United States of America.Does that no longer hold any meaning, any value?Our Constitution says that this is a place where people are treated as equals, where people have the ability to respect each other's basic human rights.We NEED to do better.We must."
1,"McDonald's Aurora, Nebraska 1601 Q St Don't ever go there. It took me 45 minutes to get my food. They weren't busy no one was in the lobby. No one was in the drive through.Don't recommend going if you do plan on waiting as long as I did. Went into The lobby one time no one was at the counter waiting stood there for a half hour just to get help highly, not recommended as a good restaurant."
1,Bad service 6/15/24 @9:30 a.m.I go.everyday to get mcdonalds. Smoothy machine almost down. Always put egg on my sausage mcmuffin and  burnt.  Always slow have to pull into wait parking. About 5 cars waiting in morning. Called manager she wouldn't give her name or morning managers name. Very rude I told her off. LouisaMontoya gave me my order. She not check order. Very upset I know her and others. Snobby gossipers!!!
3,The food is meh
5,Imade an order through the app to pick it up and it went to the wrong store. They graciously offered to make a fresh order.I am McLoving them!
1,McDonald's in Savannah Tennessee gets an -100 from me first I place a order online had receipt and they didn't give me food or anything refuse my service. Then I go back the next day get food order was messed up try tell them someone was supposed to call me replace my food still haven't and this going on almost 4 weeks very very bad don't recommend them at all then I contact McDonald's on email they haven't done anything never agsin i eat mcdonals
5,"My six year old son absolutely loves your chicken mcnuggets and french fries. Our local McDonald's in Blairsville, PA is his favorite spot. He frequently asks for happy meals and gets them for good behavior. In his words, he is amazed that the average rating is 2 stars and believes the government needs to step in on this issue and give you all 5 stars. Great job Mickey D's on your product, your initiative to stay competitive and current in a vast changing food industry, and we will continue to buy your products!"
4,"It is a very nice and cozy place, the workers are very good, they maintain good cleanliness but their cleaning does not last long since people do not help keep it clean, they have a wide variety of products, all of which are very tasty.In my opinion, the workers are sometimes very clueless, they leave the box alone and you have to wait a long time until they charge you for the order, there are few boxes and sometimes they are damaged or there is no paper in the machines.In conclusion, it is a nice place that I would recommend going to, you just have to be patient in case you have to wait but the products are very rich and varied."
1,I ordered a big Mac with extra fries and a mcnuggets combo but it took too much to have my delivery on my hands. The food was cold and the soda had no gas. It was terrible service.
1,"I just ordered a McChicken sandwich at McDonald's in Kitchener. It didn't taste very good, was an awful sandwich.  I don't eat at McDonald's that much. In the past, I used to like McChicken at McDonald's, the sandwich was tasty and juicy.  Don't eat at McDonald's, if so, you are wasting your money."
1,"WARNING !!!! Don't eat from the Charleston McDonald's Had to give one star to leave a review I actually give a negative 5 stars .. tweaker central .I watched this very nasty girl put her hands down her pants and not wash her hands to make someones food with her bare hands .. The ""mangers"" that are women are extremely over weight and grouchy and move very very slow . And the most important thing my brother in law was hospitalized for food poisoning from eating here ... Stop giving this place your money it's the worst and dirtiest fast food place in Charleston il ."
1,"I remember when we used to get a SLICE of cheese on the burgers and fish sandwiches, a half slice(🤔) NOW JUST A PIECE... What's really going on... Just ridiculous"
1,Should be zero Stars.Ordered food via McDonald’s app doesn’t appear.Visit to make a compliant and pick it requested food to be mortified and lost appetite.The cleanliness and amount of vermin that scurries in plain view of my local McDonalds is of concern.Tilbury
1,"Bad customer service, I ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin and a hash brown but never turned up ￼with my order"
1,my express is very bad i have eating the veg maharaja mac after next day my stomach pain very bad after eating  itvery bad experience of my life
1,"Ordered through McDonald's app and delivered by Uber Eats - unfortunately, yet again, the order was incomplete. Happy Meal cheeseburger and fries missing, and four dips missing also. The twenty-pack chicken nuggets appeared to be overcooked or double-fried as they were extremely dry, dark in colour, and tasteless.Called McDonald's who refused to take responsibility and was told to call Uber Eats, although the bag was sealed and it was not their fault. Very difficult phone call with Uber Eats due to their very heavy South Asian accent, customer service representative had to repeat herself multiple times until I understood that I will receive a refund for the Happy Meal minus the cost of the toy (as they claimed it's a free item) and drink (as we received it). This is not the first time this has happened but it will be the last as I will never order from there again."
3,"Thought I would have a big mac as a treat. The burger was thinner than half the bun, sauce was only just there. I won’t waste my money again, so disappointed. I suppose with a qtr pounder you know the weight of the burger.So beware if buying as really it’s a bun!"
1,"Used to be good back in the day, but not anymore. Prices are ridiculous for what they give you, never hot and fresh and each location varies in quality. Just another example of fast-food companies saying they're improving what they do to make it better when in actuality, it couldn't be any worse. Breakfast would be about the best thing going for them at this point but the burger business is terrible."
1,"It is with a heavy heart and a disappointed palate that I recount the horror of horrors that befell me at McDonald’s, a place where I once found solace in the form of a comforting meal. My anticipation for a delightful feast was met with a ghastly surprise – the ‘Sus Burger’.This burger, a far cry from the golden standards set by McDonald’s, was an affront to the very essence of fast food. The patty, which should have been the star, was instead an overcooked specter of its former self. Each bite was a reminder of the potential that was lost in flames.The vegetables, a mere garnish to the tragedy, were a wilted representation of neglect. The lettuce, which should have added a refreshing crunch, was as limp as a forgotten memory. The tomatoes, devoid of any semblance of ripeness, were a pale imitation of what they promised to be.And the bun – that cornerstone of any respectable burger – was a stale, disheartening bookend to the sad narrative within. It was supposed to be soft and yielding, yet it crumbled under the slightest pressure, much like my expectations.This was not the McDonald’s experience that I had come to cherish. This was a culinary misstep, a horror of horrors that unfolded with each regrettable bite. I urge McDonald’s to heed this tale of woe and steer back to the path of deliciousness that has charmed millions. Let not the ‘Sus Burger’ be the downfall of a beloved institution."
1,"This is the poorest McDonald's I've ever seen in my life. Terrible service, squalid environment and really trashy staff. We had dinner like in a pigsty because everything was dirty. Unfortunately we had to eat dinner because we were hungry and certainly not because we wanted to eat in a toilet like that.The manager Elsa first wanted to pretend to show some interest in managing the case and then abandoned not knowing that I would publish, but the image of that McDonald's will be ruined as well as the entire company if they don't take steps to compensate the damage caused to me. This lady pretends not to know how to reimburse the meal (at a minimum) even though she gave her US bank details.Really trashy. Avoid this Mc DONALDS and try to eat something more nutritious and non-fatty!"
2,"Serving hatch:The process for waiting at the hatch was confusing: instructions on receipt indicated to wait at collection point 1, but the collection point was not numbered or advertised as the collection point either.There was also no staff visible behind the counter and it also says my item was ready for collection for many minutes before a member of staff appeared with the food, which made me wonder if I was in the wrong place.Staff:No problems with the staff themselves: seemed nice and polite.No cutlery issue:There’s something that makes my blood boil however: serving food that requires cutlery to eat it and being given very soft cardboard cutlery to attempt to eat it with.Of course the fork breaks every time you use it and you have to leave your food to go back to the counter and ask for more cutlery, which inevitably breaks again.Either: serve food that requires cutlery with cutlery that works OR don’t serve food that requires cutlery,Honestly, if we aren’t allowed plastic cutlery then simply don’t serve the food."
1,"Overpriced, sloppy assembly, drink spilled over when inserting the straw, had to wait for two chicken sandwiches, set out to us with fries that we didn’t order, currier went back in to remove fries from bag, never receive a receipt to verify what we paid for. I won’t be eating at McDonald’s again. $20.00 for two chicken sandwiches and two soft drinks, outrageous!!!"
1,Zero if I could.  McDonald’s Customer Service is a joke.  Worst in the industry.  The agent literally hung up on me when she could not help me.
1,"We ordered via McDelivery for lunch today and 2 items from the main meal were missing.Googled the phone number for McDonald's customer service and the automated number brought us through to Uber eats where we were told firmly we will not be getting a refund.Emailed McDonald's Customer service giving them the full details of our order and screen shots of the receipts and labels from the bags. After getting 3 or 4 emails from McDonald’s Customer service asking questions like which branch and the total cost of our order, on their 5th email they said we will not be provided a refund but they can give a goodwill gesture of 2 medium meal vouchers!!!The vouchers don't even add upto the missing foods we ordered.We spend our money hoping we will be getting what we order and someone who is working in McDonald’s get the order wrong and we lose our money. Someone please explain how this works.We are never ordering through McDelivery ever again.We would not even give this one star. We wish more people read these reviews before ordering via McDelivery. We wish we had before ordering."
1,I have just been through the worst experience in McDonald at two rivers retail park in Staines . The manager Kathrina is very rude and unhelpful has no customer service acumen and the young lady don’t have her name did not open the window to take my money and kept me waiting. I asked for a manager and the young lady was very rude and walked away rather then Serving me and apologise for the delay.
1,What happened to the fish sandwich? It looks like a slider instead of a sandwich. They should warn you when you order it. I’ve bought these since I was a teen. I’m 71 now and will never order another one
1,It was raining this morning and I wanted a hot coffee. I didn't want to get out of my car so I went thru the drive thru. Ordered my coffee and was told they needed to make a new pot of decaf and would bring it out to me. I sat for over 10 mins. and no coffee. I went inside and complained they immediately got my coffee. I called to complain and was told my ordered must have been taken off the screen thinking it had been delivered they did offer a remind or another coffee. Not planning on going to the Grant Ave Auburn NY anytime in the future.
1,"I am absolutely furious and dumbfounded at the GENERIC CUSTOMER RESPONSE THAT COMES IN WHEN A CUSTOMER takes the time to submit a complaint and further more takes the time to provide the information that is initially sent upon the first email that your support team sends in. I am simply asking to replenish my 6000 points that this app took on my order that was cancelled by a technicality on the apps part. The agents response to a refund of .22 cents is not my concern. My whole point is getting something rectified that was your error to begin with. The is the SECOND TIME I GOT A GENERIC RESPONSE WHEN SENDING IN A COMPLAINT. I don't want a generic response. I want someone to fix this issue. Quit sending me a polite sorry, but not my problem email and just fix your mistake! Has McDonalds got that big that you are THIS GREEDY TO RETURN POINTS"
2,176th and meridian mcdonalds in Puyallup is an unorganized disaster. Dont waste your time going there I walk in and theres angry looking customers standing around so i ask if they ordered yet and they just shook their heads so I wait a couple.minutes as more people come in and I realize that this isn't a mcdonalds. Maybe its some hidden camera joke tv show or something. As I leave the cars in the drive through are all trying to back out as other unknowing people block them in. I yelled Dont go in get out of here! Waste of time.
2,"Very poor service food was barley warm. The service was long. Housekeeping was poor. Working 3 people on a Saturday night with inadequate training no one peer checking and very unorganized at least have someone there with there A game helping. Or just close it down when you don't have adequately trained personnel working. Start training and retrain personnel call it just in time training. Not sure if this store is a franchise or corporate someone need to check this place out. Not just during the day but at night. I do not want my money back because i did not get a receipt like always Kiosk out of paper every time the manager busy trying to make food and put orders together. It's really not their issues it the personnel doing the training. Management. They should have a 2-minute pre job brief when they start there shift and communication would be helpful when making orders. I watch them work none of the 3 are communicating or calling orders. And if your short staff and only have 3 people working close the drive thru or the dining room because the quality of the product is bad. Or close the store at 4 until you get personnel organized and trained.My order was a fish filet and double cheeseburger med coke and a child's coke. Between 8:45 pm 9:30 Pm In this day in age you should be able to track it with what was sold that day. Also, I now places are short people. But you have to hire people."
2,Attendant in store was snippy and impatient. She couldnt hear us because she also had the drive thru headset on.The fish sandwich - which I usually love - was dry and overdone. Worst one Ive ever had at McDonalds.
3,"3 stars... because half of my interaction with McDo is good (delicious, fresh, good service) while half is bad (missing item in order, late delivery, etc.)."
5,So delish!!!! Great friendly staff! Hot and yummy!
3,so my grandma was asking for ginger ale you know and they messed up with water i wonder why but everyhing else
5,"Visited McDonald's at Bobbin, Sittingbourne, Kent. Excellent service, really clean, very friendly and helpful. Quick service, food freshly cooked. Coffee was good too."
1,Had a bad experience working here. Management was too strict and very unreasonable. Working hours was not consistent and hygiene was not maintained well.
1,"At:  McDonald's - Redhouse Interchange, DONCASTER, DN6 7FBWhile waiting for service, a member of staff put both hands to their face, covering the nose and mouth and sneezed. They were directly facing the food prep area where the food orders and bags of fries are assembled and bagged.The staff member then wiped their lower face with their hands, rubbed their hands down the front of their trousers (to dry them?) and continued working at their station, handling food, while scratching their head and poking fronds of hair under the cap.NO ATTEMPT MADE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AT ALL!!!Spoke to staff that handed my order, asked them to tell the sneezing staff to wash their hands, it's basic food hygiene.  The staff I spoke to looked at the sneezing staff, who was looking at me, so I said you must wash your hands after sneezing into them in a food area. The sneezing staff pulled a face and turned back to their work, still not washing their hands.Disgusting hygiene and a flagrant eff you attitude."
1,I ordered a big mac meal large and watermelon macfizz. My macfizz it looked like it was drank and it was half full and uber eats driver Brain Jayden said that the ice melted. I was disgusted when I realise that the seal was broken and when I found dirt marks on the side of my drink. Like what did he do with my drink? Did he drink it or what? At the end I never drank it and if your uber eats driver is Brain Jayden just know that your food or drink has been eating/drank by him. Today I this 11 year 0ld boy could not enjoy his McDonalds meal. I am sad.Thank everyone.
1,"McDonalds and Uber Eats, I orders over £30 of food for delivery. When delivered I noticed the Chicken sandwich was missing, I used the app for customer service this advised me to contact Uber Eats.I contacted Uber Eats who informed me they wouldn't refund me, basically I class this as theft.Shame on McDonalds and Uber Eats, both have the lowest customer service i have ever had the misfortuneto contact.."
1,I am absolutely disgusted. I ordered food tonight through the app and never recieved my order. Uber eats say they wont give me a refund and mcdonalds just keep sending me to uber. I will never use either of these services again as I am absolutely appalled that somebody is expected to waste their money on food that never arrives. What an absolute joke of a company. As a once loyal customer of mcdonalds who had lots of points I am absolutely devastated that I have received this treatment and that a conpany would partner with such a disgusting conpany like ubereats who treat their customers with absolutely no respect.
1,"Need to sort out the Hedge End Southampton branch once and for all, close them down. They are patently USELESS as they CONSTANTLY omit things from orders and do not care about their customers being ripped off. How many WHOLE rashers of streaky bacon in a flatbread ???? They treat their customers like morons and think we don't know and don't care about what we're paying our good money for. If they intend to persist in ripping their customers off SHUT THE PLACE DOWN and let some other business that CARES about standards take over the premises. 'P up brewery'."
2,Not very good food but I love nuggets and suß sauer soße
1,"McDonald’s was a place that we love to go to and have breakfast and sometime lunch. Our problem with going there now is the seating the seats are not made for the elderly or tall people, very uncomfortable. The tall chairs and tables were perfect, now there are none.   It feel as though McDonald’s are only catering to young people and kids."
1,"Finally figured out McDonald's weak spot > McDonald's in Donegal PA.  The order taker at the window was lifeless [did not seem to care].  Gave her my order # and she said OK.  No salutation, thank you or drive up. The order was simple > 3 sandwiches - only found 2 sandwiches in bag > order taker seemed very angry when I told her of shortage.  McDonald's has tooo much competition for this to happen.  Say goodbye McDonald's"
3,"The quarter pounder is by far their best menu item. customer service is not great, but what do you expect. Prices are going up in CA because of the new fast food worker laws. SO probably wont be eating here for a while"
2,"Left my local McDonald's without my breakfast, sigh. I ordered 2 sausage burritos without the tortilla as I am trying to cut carbs. My order was taken and I paid, however when I got my order they had made the burritos with the tortilla.  I asked and the gentleman was polite but said he was told they couldn't do it that way.  I have 2 complaints.  1) why was I not told this when I ordered and 2) why can they not just put it on a bowl.Not such a great start to a Monday."
1,Disgraceful.Regularly missing food when ordered through the app for delivery. Amazing how the missing food never seems to happen when ordered in the ‘restaurants’.Phoned through again about missing food and told no refund as complained previously.Appalling.
1,"Last time I ordered 4 cheeseburgers In aalborg Østerågade 17 it was really dry and had almost no taste.It seems like these cheese burgers has been sitting the whole day - no wonder they where so fast delivering me this awful ""food"""
1,mcdonalds is very greasy and fat food.
1,Hello I'm here in Italy here is a McDonald's in biella via San Maurizio 27b the staff of McDonald's is very rude specially the two lady manager's they are abusing and using bad words they are saying no one ask these two are very resist you people plz take action against them tnk u
3,"Well, Mc Donald's is always good in terms of food service and the employees are always nice. But when I went to Mc Donald's this time they gave me the wrong order and didn't want to give me the right one. But, this might just have been the location because this hadn't happened to me before. Normally the service is great so I would give it a try."
1,I walked into McDonalds and orders my food and I received my burger (triple cheese burger I'm a fatty) anyways i sat down at table 11 and bit into my burger and there was a hair so i opened my burger to find 7 food flies and a lot of blonde hair that looked like pubes.
5,"This is my favorite fast food. Can eat cheeseburgers nonstop, I just find them really tasty."
1,They’re food sucks and they’re service sucks
5,Il Crispy mc bacon è qualcosa di incredibile!!!!!Il Big Mac e il Double Chicken BBQ sono extra buoni!Provateli subitoooooooooooooooooooooo!
1,"McDonald's Ashford Surrey . ordered cheesy bites , didn't turn up , ordered two Mcflurries , didn't turn up , ordered two medium chips and two milkshakes and two hot apple pies , EUREKA  they turned up , ordered two big macs , EUREKA one turned up fine , the other one had lettuce in the box not the burger , no sauce and one bit of pickle and the best bit ONE BURGER IN A BIG MAC    Why didn't they deliver some of the drugs they must be on as well !!!!!!!!!"
2,"I ordered a big mac at 11.30 didn't receive it,so I would like a refund please and won't be ordering from you again."
1,They don't have Small Fries for Healthier Choices.
1,Every time I go to McDonald’s and want a strawberry milk shake with my Big Mac. They don’t have the shake. I am disgusted with what I am seeing now. No excuse
5,The McDonald’s on stride Ave in Castro Valley ca has got to be the worst service storeThey are close so I think convenienceThey have f….. up my orders numerous times and none of them care or speak EnglishJust now I ordered a 4a w a Diet CokeAnd a 4c just the sandwichEnded up with a quarter pounder meal and the 4 c sandwichThey said I will switch it and I was yelling and screaming for a refundThen ordering a 4a w a Diet Coke and the added apple slices by this time I was so pissed that I gave it back and they had charged me for the slices.I’m calling them until I get a real person to speak to.
4,The consistency you guys have with your service I like
1,"bad food, bad service"
1,"Stupid MacDonald's app cant update email address or rest cant log into account i don't have the old email address anymore LOST 50,000 points 2 years of points no help from MacDonald done this on purpose how many people are locked out from their accounts lost points"
1,"We ordered 2 of the new adult Happy Meals. What a joke! The first surprise was the $28 for 2 meals. The second was the pathetic smallness of the meal. The Big Mac was dry, cold and old tasting, the fries were ice cold and finally one of the meals didn’t have the toy! We were so mad we didn’t go back. AND we had to wait over 10 minutes to get everything even though there were no other customers there. I feel they took food from warming trays and slapped the meal together. Never again!"
1,"I ordered the frost box tpday only tp realize once I got home I only got the bignac- there was no toy or anything else besides the big Mac and drink. I definitely don't recommend ordering it as it only seems to come with a big Mac and drink, no toy."

1,"I ordered a nugget meal at store 18978 on Commercial St SE in Salem Oregon today and got something in place of my nuggets that I couldn’t even identify.  When I called the store, and spoke with Nicole, I was told I would need to come back to get new food, which wasn’t possible as I was already on the freeway heading out of town.  When I contacted corporate through the complaint webpage I was referred to the local office and heard from the area supervisor Ranelle, who at first was nice, however after sending pictures of what I received, became short with minimal response.  Seriously…no wonder the service is so poor.  Won’t be returning to any location in that area!"
2,"Every time I order online, something is forgotten. Today, I ordered a crispy sweet chilli wrap meal, they delivered everything but the wrap. How can you forget the main part of the meal????"
5,"The food was amazing and the people were so nice and David one of employes were so nice,hard working and jolly he really bring the Christmas spirit to us."
1,"1. As a store Mgr in the 80's I know McDonalds has higher standards then what Decatur Al. Is showing us. I was handed a wrong order, then I got my adult happy meal and she didn't know what drink I had nor size. She gave a small when the receipt says large. Come on Decatur Al. Use tht training, instill some pride and work ethic in your people."
1,"Ordered 3 deluxe quarter pounders, got home with them no deluxe. Go back to McDonald’s here in Warsaw, mo. And they swapped them out for the right ones( so I thought) got home once again and feeling really glad to have the right cheeseburgers. We both bite into them and dang we must’ve had about a pound or so of mayo on each sandwich. Just terrible. WTH is going on there. 2 managers on duty 7:30 at night. Slower than crap inside and drive thru. Do you guys even want customers? I don’t understand how this works for anyone…. The manager, the cooks, the order taker or owner. Without  customers you don’t have a business( a lot of businesses and their employees seem to forget that!) very disappointed! Someone fix the problem please. I also have a picture of this to share!"
