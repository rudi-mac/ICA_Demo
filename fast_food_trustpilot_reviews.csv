www.mcdonalds.com,5,"The serving of chicken meal is now larger, compared to previous months. Coke float, hamburger, and Hot Fudge sundae tastes great too!"
www.mcdonalds.com,5,"Place was clean, which isn’t always the case with busy locations. Solid spot for a quick meal on the go."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Placed my order at 5:33am through your app. When I got there they said we are closed with no manager. I said I already paid through your app. He said I can't help you with that. When the manager came in she said it will take a while to get things started. I said I will wait. are a few minutes the manager asked me to pull up and she would bring out my order. They brought out 2 different orders none of which was mine.  I waited and waited, and my order came out at 6:15am. The employee asked me to leave the drive through area or they will call the police. I had asked for a receipt, and no one came out with my receipt. I went inside and asked for a receipt and the manager ignored me. I finally had to ask an employee to print me a receipt. I was finally able to leave with my order at 6:30am. I would not recommend this location to anyone. Why would anyone wait about an hour to have my order completed????"
www.mcdonalds.com,5,"I liked the chips better than the burger... however, all of em tasted great!"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Ugh, I asked for extra pickles and they gave me one… like girl math says that’s actually negative pickles."
www.mcdonalds.com,5,"Macdonald's is always a reliable choice when you want quick ,tasty food and a good price.The service is usually fast ,the staff are friendly and the restaurants are clean and confortable and the menu has something for everyone from classic Burgers a d fries to New seasonal items."
www.mcdonalds.com,4,Their movie-themed floats were refreshing but the flavors are not that unique compared to other drinks. I wished a wider variety of flavors next time.
www.mcdonalds.com,3,"This branch in Richmond, VA was decent. The food came out hot and the order was correct. The wait time was a little longer than expected, but overall it was an average experience."
www.mcdonalds.com,5,"services Differ From Place To Place, but geenrally its good food."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I had to put a star but trust me they don’t deserve it. The store on WALES RD. In JACKSON OHIO, is by far the worst McDonald’s that has ever opened their doors and is stocked full of the most uneducated, unhygienic, rudest dirtiest slowest members of society that call themselves employees. This place needs to shut down like ASAP and never ever try to reopen again. I have personally NEVER had ONE good experience here not ONE"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Bad food, bad taste and employees are unfriendly especially in my area. I recommend other fast-food dining restaurants..."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,If you want to pay for an order and not receive all you paid for only to be fobbed of and gaslighted by staff by all means use the ryde branch if you want on brand service go to Newport
www.mcdonalds.com,5,My favorite place to get dinner after midnight.

www.mcdonalds.com,1,today I was double billed on one single order that was all  wrong and when I contacted them they are refusing to give me one of the refunds stating they cant well you had no problem taking two one for 23 and one for 17 I hope other people read this and be careful double check your accounts and make sure they dont take more than the order should be
www.mcdonalds.com,3,The food was cold the employees was nasty and hateful never have a kind word to say.
www.mcdonalds.com,5,I think McDonald is an incredible place to eat delicious and cheap because it have a good prices and the quality is ok.I recommend McDonald’s💗
www.mcdonalds.com,4,"For me, the service is good; it's fast, efficient, and has excellent prices. The burgers and fries are delicious, as are the desserts. I'd like to see security in the restaurants. They have many locations, and the food tastes very similar."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"We went to the McDonald’s in zanesville ohio.  The staff was so inappropriate  and curing at each other, saying the f word.  It took us 40 min to get our food, if the worker would have just stopped complained and eating then she could have moved the customers along.  Also, my friend asked about her med fries she order ( only thing ordered) asked since her number disappearedThe worker got her fries in a bag and threw them at my disabled friend.Then she said once I get this lobby cleared I’m closing up and quitting."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Absolutely disgusting the food was freezing when it was delivered, you could tell this must have been sat on a hot plate/under a crappy heat lamp, it would have been under that long that it made the food rubbery - we could’t eat it and tried the dog with the food and he wouldn’t go anywhere near it !! McDonald’s I don’t know why you bother to offer delivery of food, especially if you can’t keep it warm/fresh for your customers - you should be ashamed - my delivery times changed a few times and was kept getting put back - makes you wonder if that food had been sat a hell of a long time !!! I won’t be ordering or bother going to one of your establishments again !!Ryhope McDonald’s"

www.mcdonalds.com,1,I went to US for my business expansion and visited a mcdonalds closby to my motel. Food was too much pricey than in my hometown and tastes too much bad for my palette. Japans mcdonalds is much better. Mcdonalds need to improve their service and taste
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I went into their store at 5130 n Sheridan Road in Chicago on June 7th at 853p to purchase their $6.00 meal deal on their app. It was rung up at $7 and tax. Total of $7.76. It was shown on their board as $6.00 too not including tax. When i brought up to honor the $6.00 price i was refused by the cashier and the man they sent over when I asked to speak to the manager. It was only the matter of a dollar but I was treated like I was the one at fault and treated poorly. Besides McDonald's makes zillions of dollars dont they? I'm also a disabled senior. When I called their corporate office the young kid on the phone treated me poorly as well. He said they issued you a refund didn't they? I said for the whole meal not the dollar difference. Besides I demanded it because they refused to honor the $6.00 price. Also, the kid in corporate on my call to them acted as if they did me a big favor and gave me food for free or something. As i said i was refunded what they charged me for it which was a dollar more than on on their app which was lower. Also he added now i know why you were treated like that. Honest thats the absolute truth! Also i feel discrimination at the store and on the call. Thats how they settled it. I was told they would pass it along to the store manager. Thats all. I was told that it was to be passed on to the stores manager. It was not settled by mcdonalds corporate office. I requested a gift card for my trouble and I was refused that. Also the credit at my bank is showing at zero dollars. I need to contact me bank after I submit this. Additional thoughts their food wasn't any good in the first place. Most of the time it is served warm. Also too expensive now for what is given. Not pleasing to my eyes. From now on I refuse to go to any mcdonalds again. There is a circle k and marianos close by and when im looking to pick up something I will go there for a quick bite. Again that restaurant and McDonald's corporate doesn't care about their customers as I see. Many reputable companies would treat this in a matter which would show they care about their customers. McDonald's corporate doesn't care period. Also the customer service rep was also very rude and kept interrupting me when I spoke. Repeating that I already told him something when I didn't. Goodbye McDonald's with your corporate greed! Also apparently want to rip people off and scam the public as indicated here by over charging the customers."
www.mcdonalds.com,5,"McDonald’s is the best. The app and the discounts really help. I saved $7 while using the McDonalds app. I literally only order through the app from now on. Great food, great people."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"No matter where in the world why do people still eat mc Donald's it's fake and poisonous, I mean dang how hungry are you!!!!! High prices disgusting food and now it looks like a gray jail!!!! I haven't eaten there for years and I'm very cautious of other establishment s too especially taco bell 🤮 and the date is a date of my review not experience"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"The is the worst mcdonalds I have been to. 70345 Hwy 21 Covington, LA 70433. They gave me an uncooked sandwich that was cold with stale bread. You go inside the business and understand why right away. Just left with no food and money gone. I will never return to this sorry dump."

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I have stopped at the Hwy 82, Greenville, MS location several times and have yet to get my order of a Diet Coke correct.  Today's flavor tasted like Dr. Pepper.  If someone orders a diet anything just maybe they are diabetic and can't drink sugar drinks!  Today they also decided I was not deserving of cheese on my sausage, egg AND CHEESE biscuit.  This is truly getting ridiculous.  If the people of Greenville would boycott these ""fast food"" restaurants I bet the powers that be would do something about the laziness and don't care attitudes their employees have!  Needless to say today was my last trip to any McDonalds.  I will make my own breakfast, at least that way I will get what I want!"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I visited several time to the Mcdonald's on rt33 Mercerville NJ, the manager a spanish guy is miserable he doesn't look at you or say good morning or hello. But to me one of the most important this is he is not veteran friendly he makes faces and click his tongue when ask and prove that you'll a veteran. Why is he working there??? Without the veterans he wouldn't even have a job! While he was sleeping in a warm bed I was fighting in war for his freedom and our country's freedom! GOD BLESS THE USA!"

www.mcdonalds.com,1,McDonald's food is cancerous. Mice won't eat it. Sit out for four years and still looks a day old. McDonald's food will put you in your grave after you suffer really bad cancer  before their food puts you in the graveyard after a long painful time. McDonald's should be permanently closed for poisoning people.
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Ondara McDonalds.I really fancied a burger and the queue at Burger King was too big for my hunger. So i thought i'd try MacDonalds.. which had no queue.. zero queue.Now i know why. What a shameful excuse of a burger, with ignorant staff and crap food. No wonder Burger King is trouncing you! I wasted 12quid and had to get a burger king on the way home to get the taste of macdonalds out my mouth! Ideally you should give a refund. But you're too shameful to do that of course."

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Bellies Hill roundabout Lanarkshire, Scotland McDonalds restaurant at 15:00 on Friday 18/04/2025, I visited this place with wife, son and a friend, on entering the restaurant there was food and serviettes strewn across the floor and on tables. We ordered ( my wife and I had just driven up from Yorkshire). I asked at the counter for some one to clean table number 8 which she cleaned however ignoring the food on floor and other tables.As I suffer from a bowel problem I went to the toilet which was rammed with lots of human waste and toilet tissue. I informed the cleaner who said he would sort it. He started cleaning the restaurant and as I had checked my watch when I informed him it was 15:15 at 15:45 I went back to the toilet only to find it in the same disgusting filthy state. This time I went to the counter to see the manager who completely ignored me when the young lady told him that I wished to see him. FIVE minutes later I had to call across the counter that I wished to speak to him. I reported the situation to him and he completely ignored me. I am now (as a fully qualified Health and Safety person am seriously considering reporting this to the local environmental health office.S. Balmer"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,For McDonalds on Montano Albuquerque NM. Went there to order a happy meal for my granddaughter. No onions the smart ass who prepared the meal put about a half cup of onions on the burger. Who does that to a child?

www.mcdonalds.com,1,McDonalds warwick Blvd near CNU in Newport News. Eggs nearly hurned. Reminder to check your food in the drive thru before you pull away.
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Went to McDonald's Ryde Isle of Wight this afternoon.Nice burgers, but fries were awful, they wererope'y, even the birds won't eat them.Next time I visit McDonald's I will skip thefries and just order burgers and drinks etc."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,I run asleep don't think that McDonald's even reserves a star because of the fact that they are grinding up humans I mean I don't even produce as much cows as they're producing an hamburger it might not even be real we could be eating people not thinking about that I haven't ate fast food and over a year and a chicken sandwich the other day and threw a ride up so my body doesn't even want that s*** I don't judge anyone that likes McDonald's me I just can't do it nasty
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I rarely go to McDonalds, but happened to visit the Portsmouth North Harbour outlet on 14/01/2025 where there was a 20 minute wait, kiosk machines not working properly and giving no receipts. When the food finally arrived it was cold, and the milkshakes contaminated with multiple flavours. Complained to McDonalds Customer Services who initially tried to ignore the complaint because I didn't have a receipt, even though their machines had run out of till roll. I was eventually given a QR code to redeem a free meal as compensation which I tried to claim at the McDonald's in Southampton West Quay Retail Park on 31/03/2025. Once again, multiple kiosks not working and all had run out of till roll so no receipts. The kiosk wouldn't accept the QR code to redeem my free meal, so I waited a the front counter for over 10 minutes, being repeatedly ignored by multiple staff members, until I eventually walked out in frustration (and without my meal). Completely disgraceful company, I will be avoiding McDonald's at all costs. The fact that none of their Trustpilot profiles have been claimed and the sheer number of negative reviews tells you everything.I'm not lovin' it."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I went to McDonalds, and I ordered a hamburger with pickles. Instead, they gave me a mc double with cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, and ketchup. There weren't even pickles on the hamburger. I also ordered a cheeseburger, and they did the same thing with the cheeseburger. Clearly this McDonalds doesn't listen to your orders very well. The McDonalds was in Livermore on Vasco Road. If this continues with any other McDonalds, I will no longer buy from them."

www.mcdonalds.com,1,If you’re not going to revamp the way the workers treat the customers you might as well shut down. We will get to a point of boycotting because it is getting absolutely ridiculous! The person taking your order in the drive through is disgusting and gives no apologies. Closes the door right in your face no thank you nothing pleasant at all. You cannot continue to write that off as being busy. Do you know why you’re busy? Because we are coming to spend our money!! I have dealt with an annoyed attitude for the last time at this McDonald’s.
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"You know maccy d's was elite back in the day I feel like it became washed after a couple of bad years I mean people still eat there because its like a staple of fast food but let me tell you like the small fast-food restaurants that you can find are like 100% better and also wayyy cheaper, like for mcd you need to spend so much money and not even been filled up"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"WOULD BE 0 STARS IF I COULD!!! The store at 1900 N State Rd 7(441) Hollywood Fl. Is a joke! This is my 3rd complaint. Today was a DOOZIE! My breakfast bill was $6.51 I paid with a $20 so my change was $13.49, the cashier says here is $13.00 I do not have change ($.49) so I said so give me $1. Her reply was NO MY DRAWER WILL BE SHORT; WE HAVE NO CHANGE IN THE STORE! UMMMM excuse me I said as the customer that is not my problem I should not be shorted since your store is not prepared. I asked for the manager and of course her reply was ""I AM THE MANAGER"" she said hold on and slammed the drive thru window in my face....I waited like 3-4 minutes for her return to her to say ""HERE and shoved $.40 at me still $.09 short but that was fine. Then I get my food hash brown ice cold like wasn't even cooked and sausage McMuffin hard as a rock like it was sitting for 30+minutes. Why should I be punished since your store has no change??? KIARA was the ""managers"" name DO BETTER McDONALDS DO BETTER!!!!!! and still 9 hours later no call back from corporate about this situation. Now here is another scam the store at 5385 Hollywood Blvd in Hollywood is running through the drive thru since this is our other main store....be aware when you go to the drive thru they have started asking ""DO YOU WANT YOUR CHANGE???"" UMMM Heck Yeah, I Do why would I give it to you??? so at the end of the night you can have $100+ dollars McDonalds your employees are thief's and just plain RUDE....DO BETTER"

www.mcdonalds.com,1,Big mistake firing their CEO for having a girlfreind who worked at Mcdonalds. Who the heck cares about that. Dont fire the guy. Where else is he supposed to meet people?New CEO came in a trippled prices. Now the stores are empty. I pulled all my stock out of Mcdonalds. They have lost their way. Cluless board of directors who fired the ceo. Poor leadership. Food makes you feel likw crap after eating it. For most people it doesnt make sense to go here whwn you can go to a local burger joint for the same price. Mcdonalds used to be fairly priced for what you get. Prices dont reflect inflation they are way higher than inflation.Customer service is worse than it was in past decardes. American workforce is notorius for being apathetic and that is what you get these days at Mcds. Bleached wheat flour also causes diabetes and it is in 80% of their food. Google it. I was a life long customer but will not go back there since their pirce gauging and new CEO. If they fire him and lower prices Id consider going back.
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"My experience at McDonald's was a real disappointment. What disappointed me the most was the lack of cleanliness at the tables. I sat at a table that looked like it had not been cleaned, with leftover food and drink from previous customers.The table was dirty, and there was even ketchup that someone had left behind. I felt disgusted at having to sit at such a dirty table.Also, my mom had to clean the table, which I thought was horrible since that should be done by the staff. The overall lack of cleanliness made me feel like it wasn't worth going back to that place.All in all, my experience at McDonald's was very disappointing, and the lack of cleanliness at the tables was the worst. I hope they take steps to improve the cleanliness, Thank you."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"McDonald’s seriously needs to be shut down. This place is horrible and the food is old and disgusting and there apples slices are always expired but they sell them anyway! How disgusting is that?? The people they hire are very disrespectful and rude or they are on drugs and are too high to get your order right. I mean they can’t even make a plain cheeseburger to save their life and one time I ordered a mcchicken and they didn’t put the chicken on it!!! How do you forget the main ingredient, it’s literally the name of the sandwich ???!!!"
www.mcdonalds.com,1,Whatever you do steer clear from the McDonalds on 47th and broadway in wichita. I went there tonight and had the worst experience ever. First I went in the store and placed my order by kiosk then when I get to the counter to pay I stood there for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me then when they finally did while in there eating I had to listen to 2 young guys and 1 of the managers having an intense conversation and every other word was a cuss word and they weren't being quiet about it either then I had to hear one of the guys tell a story about how a man came through the drive thru and was talking under his breath in the speaker so he screamed into the speaker calling that man a bastard! Really this is the type of people that McDonalds wants serving their customers?! Not only was it appalling but it was really irritating the lack of leadership that their so called manager had cause she wasn't even trying to correct those guys matter of fact she was joining in with all the cussing! So unprofessional and disturbing. And all while they were cussing their buttons off there was a young boy maybe 6 to 8 years old in there eating dinner with his dad he didn't need to hear all of that from them. So yeah if you want to actually enjoy your meal go to a different McDonalds because this one doesn't seem to care about customers and customer service. At least not good customer service.

Pulled in upto the ordering speakers, waited 10 12 seconds no one acknowled I'm there.  After another 15 seconds  I started yelping at the speaker hello hello, anyone there?  Nothing. drove around past the empty pay window and stopped at the pick up window.  Saw a girl there who looked right at me, turned around and walked off.

Didn't see any of them in the building.I don't care what's going on, shift change, spilled grease, 2 in the bathrooms.  You don't leave customer hanging.

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"I hereby register my dissatisfaction with the service received at one of the McDonald's units. On January 29th, I was at the store located in Regi Budapest and was served by an employee with glasses and blond curly hair at the checkout who demonstrated an extreme lack of cordiality and professionalism. From the beginning of the interaction, the attendant appeared impatient and rude, not clarifying my doubts and treating me with inattention. Furthermore, his unfriendly attitude and lack of interest in providing good service compromised my experience at the restaurant. I understand that adverse situations can occur, but I believe that the quality of customer service should be a priority for a company the size of McDonald's."

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Anyone that has ever been to a store already knows how poorly they run, but I had no idea the entire corporation was this bad! I have had orders screwed up and they offer no phone support, no email support, no message support and their online ap sucks. No where does it assist user with filing complaint ref wrong order given. They have fb page, also useless. No one ever responds from that too. Then I saw the other day, a store that had 2 drive through lanes. They take order from left lane. Then right lane, then left then right, etc. This seems stupid to me. And it doesn't make anything go faster,it's the same. Anyway I pull up,car in left lane, right was empty, I pull right. Then they took order the next 3 cars, all in left lane. I had to pull up and ask, is it broken on the right or what?! Worst corporation I've ever seen. Nothing runs correctly!!!"

It's blatant disrespect they hand out this slop. They know it's bad and they don't care.

www.mcdonalds.com,5,"I recently visited McDonald’s, and I had a fantastic experience! The service was quick and friendly, making my visit enjoyable from start to finish. I ordered the classic Big Mac meal, and it was delicious—perfectly cooked with all the classic flavors I love.The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, which added to the overall positive experience. I also appreciated the variety of menu options available, from their iconic burgers to healthier choices like salads and fruit.What stood out the most was the efficiency of the staff. My order was ready in no time, and they even checked to make sure everything was correct. It's great to see such commitment to customer service!Overall, I highly recommend McDonald’s for a satisfying meal at a great value. Whether you’re in the mood for a quick bite or a full meal, you can always count on McDonald’s to deliver!"

However, they have a special bonus program thal allows me to accumulate my bonus points for each purchase and get some discount later. The annoying thing is that every time I order, my order number disappears from the display shortly, or it appears on the ""ready"" side when actually it's not ready. It disappears even from there too! What a nonsence.. I have to stay there at the desk and wait until it gets done. I also have to ask staff about my order and they always say kinda ""wait a bit, please"". This is weird.. Always! It's the second reason for rating it lower."
www.mcdonalds.com,5,I had bought tea through the drive through on the mobile app. We were told to pull up and they would bring it to me soon. My wife and I waited and waited and waited. Finally I went in to find out if we had been forgotten. No. They were making it. After waiting I asked to see the manager. She informed me they were making it. After a time (twenty minutes) one of the line workers came to the front and told her it was broken and couldn't be fixed till the next day. They had no other beverages to offer as the carbonation didn't work on the sodas also. Now you might be saying. You rated them five? Well I contacted the store owner who made it right by giving my wife and I vouchers to get drinks. Yes all I wanted was what I paid for. He said he would address his staff. Management didn't just ignore. That's good business.

Doordash delivers the ""sealed"" bag of my order. I find I am missing a 10 piece nugget and the fries were not quite done.  Mcdonalds policy is call Doordash and get credit or refund.  Instead I made the 6 mile drive one way because I did not want a refund or credit, I wanted my food as it was ordered for a reason.  The manager, I did not ask her name but was right about 4:15 pm when i was there, was professional for the most part and gave me the missing nuggets and replaced my fries.  She also told me calling doordash was policy and to do that next time. I asked her how is it doordashes fault when its Mc'donald not putting the food in the bags. She just looked at me and said have a good say which is annoying management can't even give an answer. They think everyone's out for free food and that just crap!McDonald's bags and seals them shut and sets them in place to be picked up.  Doordashers cant even inspect to see if everything has been bagged because it's ""already sealed shut"".  It makes no sense to me how that can even be policy.It gets very frustrating, no matter how minor or how big the mistakes are in deliveries but I kid you not 9/10 they are wrong.  Don;t go by numbers and stats cuz we all know a crap ton of people dont bother with complaining just like me for years.A suggestion for all fast foods would be to put someone on quality inspection, inspection every bag before it gets sealed for delivery.  I bet this would go a long ways for keeping customers happy.  But it is NOT a delivery services fault and I hope you all see the flaw in this policy!this needs changing..........Have a question or feedback about a delivery order?

www.mcdonalds.com,1,I did a take out order number 281 for 1 Hotcakes and Sausage and 1 Big Brk w/HC and 1 Hash Brown which is on the receipt i was given from Front Counter Side1 8/24/2024 08:20 AM. at the Cortez Rd location in Bradenton Florida .   When I got home and took the order out of the bag. I was not given the sausage I asked for and that I paid for that was on my receipt.   I was not going back due to the incompetence of your staff.  It is obvious that they do not verify the order from the ticket they have from what the customer ordered or they just don't care!!  I am very disappointed and will not be returning.  This issue has been posted on all social media sites.  Your staff needs to be trained on all aspects of customer service because I am sure I am not the only one who has received an incorrect order!  VERY POOR SERVICE

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"PSA: unless you like someone arguing with you or being rude to you, making your child cry, or if you enjoy your food coughed on…avoid McDonalds on Missouri Avenue and Jasper street. The manager Jose, is the one that is causing issues.This is now the 6th issue we have had. We are no longer giving this McDonald’s our business. It started out as just him being curt, (which I chalked up to we all have a rough day, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt); escalated to staff calling me crazy lady because I counted my change wrong and missed giving them a nickel (she said it on the microphone to other employees in Spanish; I speak Spanish by the way!); escalated to him and staff being rude and laughing (making us question the safety of the food); escalated to him arguing with my child until she was crying over a cup she wanted to buy; escalated to him sneezing and coughing all over the equipment he used to ring upthe order in the drive thru, then laughing with a staff member as I drove away. I actually had said bless you and I’m sorry you have to work while you are sick? He said, “they don’t care”. I said your manager makes you work while sick and he began laughing. I actually have safety and harassment concerns at this point because I called the store to complain to his manager and he refused to give me any information, other than he is the manager. He used the caller id to call me back without my consent, and began arguing with me. I have also seen him walk past my house on several occasions. I have reported to corporate but am now afraid of retaliation! Please be careful and stay away from this. Location. Store number 6665. 1590 Missouri Ave Largo FL!"

When you walk in you need to catch someone, be aware if their running out to give food to drive thru they won’t stop to help you. Your chances of someone helping you is probably bother a worker who’s seating down taking their break. Because other than them, you won’t see anyone around. Once someone makes eye contact with you they just point at the kiosk thing and say you can order their, I explained that I have my children with me and can’t exactly pay attention to what I’m clicking and I need specific plain burgers etc. and they make you wait more so they can go do drive thru first. So I went to the drive thru instead and pull to the side to make sure I get what I ordered. Good thing I did because they didn’t give me any ketchup and was missing an order. After 45minutes of b***. Still no apology after I never gave them a fight. So here I am letting people know how sh** they can be now."

www.mcdonalds.com,1,Order at Kiosk and there is no receipt paper and hand sanitizer is out at all stalls.  Order number is called and placed on counter before I could ask for my cup which is never given when order is placed.  Finally get someone's attention (the front of the store is not manned by anyone.  This is a big no no in food retail.) and they get my cup.  Go to drink area and it is filthy.  No lids for medium or large drinks  Tables are filthy as well.  Seems like the only attention the employees pay is to the drive thru.  There was one employee sitting in the lobby on break I guess.  When I worked at McDonald's you did not take your break until the dining room was at least in a presentable order.  These three McDonald's in Kinston haven't been good for a long time but have gone down even more since the new owners have taken over.  Comments and complaints to them always go unanswered.

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"Eating at McDonald's has never made me so disappointed, and unfortunately, I am not only referring to the slow service and gross food.Nashville has a huge problem that isn't a very popular or well-liked topic: the amount of people who are stranded on the streets is overwhelming. Worse is the fact that this huge, bustling, tourist-riden city fails to provide the bare minimum amount of resources and services for those of us who are bound by these unimaginable circumstances.See, it became clear to me as I stood in line at this McDonald's: This city is more concerned with the appearance of their McDonald's restroom than to allow equal rights to all who reside here. We are all not granted the ability to use the same public facilities when nature calls - as it does for us all, no matter how much money we have, what we look like, or where we come from.It's 2024, and the restrooms are still segregated...I would go on into more explicit details, but I think you can all grasp the point I am making.It showed me something beautiful in the midst of such terrible discrimination, sadness, and mistreatment.We are no longer living in times of slavery, Hitler, or sexcism.We are in the United States of America.Does that no longer hold any meaning, any value?Our Constitution says that this is a place where people are treated as equals, where people have the ability to respect each other's basic human rights.We NEED to do better.We must."

Very difficult phone call with Uber Eats due to their very heavy South Asian accent, customer service representative had to repeat herself multiple times until I understood that I will receive a refund for the Happy Meal minus the cost of the toy (as they claimed it's a free item) and drink (as we received it).

www.mcdonalds.com,1,"It is with a heavy heart and a disappointed palate that I recount the horror of horrors that befell me at McDonald’s, a place where I once found solace in the form of a comforting meal. My anticipation for a delightful feast was met with a ghastly surprise – the ‘Sus Burger’.This burger, a far cry from the golden standards set by McDonald’s, was an affront to the very essence of fast food. The patty, which should have been the star, was instead an overcooked specter of its former self. Each bite was a reminder of the potential that was lost in flames.The vegetables, a mere garnish to the tragedy, were a wilted representation of neglect. The lettuce, which should have added a refreshing crunch, was as limp as a forgotten memory. The tomatoes, devoid of any semblance of ripeness, were a pale imitation of what they promised to be.And the bun – that cornerstone of any respectable burger – was a stale, disheartening bookend to the sad narrative within. It was supposed to be soft and yielding, yet it crumbled under the slightest pressure, much like my expectations.This was not the McDonald’s experience that I had come to cherish. This was a culinary misstep, a horror of horrors that unfolded with each regrettable bite. I urge McDonald’s to heed this tale of woe and steer back to the path of deliciousness that has charmed millions. Let not the ‘Sus Burger’ be the downfall of a beloved institution."

Dont waste your time going there I walk in and theres angry looking customers standing around so i ask if they ordered yet and they just shook their heads so I wait a couple.minutes as more people come in and I realize that this isn't a mcdonalds. Maybe its some hidden camera joke tv show or something. As I leave the cars in the drive through are all trying to back out as other unknowing people block them in. I yelled Dont go in get out of here! Waste of time.
www.mcdonalds.com,2,"Very poor service food was barley warm. The service was long. Housekeeping was poor. Working 3 people on a Saturday night with inadequate training no one peer checking and very unorganized at least have someone there with there A game helping. Or just close it down when you don't have adequately trained personnel working. Start training and retrain personnel call it just in time training. Not sure if this store is a franchise or corporate someone need to check this place out. Not just during the day but at night. I do not want my money back because i did not get a receipt like always Kiosk out of paper every time the manager busy trying to make food and put orders together. It's really not their issues it the personnel doing the training. Management. They should have a 2-minute pre job brief when they start there shift and communication would be helpful when making orders. I watch them work none of the 3 are communicating or calling orders. And if your short staff and only have 3 people working close the drive thru or the dining room because the quality of the product is bad. Or close the store at 4 until you get personnel organized and trained.My order was a fish filet and double cheeseburger med coke and a child's coke. Between 8:45 pm 9:30 Pm In this day in age you should be able to track it with what was sold that day. Also, I now places are short people. But you have to hire people."
www.mcdonalds.com,2,Attendant in store was snippy and impatient. She couldnt hear us because she also had the drive thru headset on.The fish sandwich - which I usually love - was dry and overdone. Worst one Ive ever had at McDonalds.

www.mcdonalds.com,1,Had a bad experience working here. Management was too strict and very unreasonable. Working hours was not consistent and hygiene was not maintained well.
www.mcdonalds.com,1,"At:  McDonald's - Redhouse Interchange, DONCASTER, DN6 7FBWhile waiting for service, a member of staff put both hands to their face, covering the nose and mouth and sneezed. They were directly facing the food prep area where the food orders and bags of fries are assembled and bagged.The staff member then wiped their lower face with their hands, rubbed their hands down the front of their trousers (to dry them?) and continued working at their station, handling food, while scratching their head and poking fronds of hair under the cap.NO ATTEMPT MADE TO WASH THEIR HANDS AT ALL!!!Spoke to staff that handed my order, asked them to tell the sneezing staff to wash their hands, it's basic food hygiene.  The staff I spoke to looked at the sneezing staff, who was looking at me, so I said you must wash your hands after sneezing into them in a food area. The sneezing staff pulled a face and turned back to their work, still not washing their hands.Disgusting hygiene and a flagrant eff you attitude."
www.mcdonalds.com,1,I ordered a big mac meal large and watermelon macfizz. My macfizz it looked like it was drank and it was half full and uber eats driver Brain Jayden said that the ice melted. I was disgusted when I realise that the seal was broken and when I found dirt marks on the side of my drink. Like what did he do with my drink? Did he drink it or what? At the end I never drank it and if your uber eats driver is Brain Jayden just know that your food or drink has been eating/drank by him.

I will never use either of these services again as I am absolutely appalled that somebody is expected to waste their money on food that never arrives. What an absolute joke of a company. As a once loyal customer of mcdonalds who had lots of points I am absolutely devastated that I have received this treatment and that a conpany would partner with such a disgusting conpany like ubereats who treat their customers with absolutely no respect.

burger-king.de,1,burger king burgers are soggy(trash burgers king)
burger-king.de,1,Cold chicken Royal with brown lettuce looked like it came out of a bin with a few cold chips
burger-king.de,1,when we entered straight away we saw burgers being made without gloves and presumably no washed hands or hair nets. When i recieved my burger a blue to be precice.. fake nail was found in my burger i am appalled with this. Staff were rude and judged me for what i ordered and gossiped to the other workers about it. After all this i had waited a whole 35 mins for just  1 burger. Absolute disgrace.
burger-king.de,1,Poor customer service and horrible and cannot get orders rightNo hand wash and weave and fake nails sometimes found in the food.
burger-king.de,1,I ordered delivery and the driver was on her period and all the blood was in my burger also she was such a tramp she had poo in her hair and also she said she had used my fries as a dildo and she tried to hook up with me but I said no because she looks like a minor also she faked walking she’s actually in a wheelchair in the paraolimpics like Stephen hawking
burger-king.de,1,went to Havant branch yesterday. Order at kisik almost 40minute wait as staff where more interested in packing the 8 or so delivery drivers that kept coming in. Totally shocking instore should be your priority espicallt when the deliver drivers keep turning up even after you orderedThey need to bad deliver drovers during peak time
burger-king.de,1,"I ordered two meals via a delivery service. Whopper meal with vanilla milkshake, and Chicken royale meal with a vanilla milkshake. The milkshakes were missing from both meals(claim through delivery service ongoing). I refused the fizzy drinks the driver tried to give me and decided to keep the meals and put in a claim for the milkshakes as per the drivers instruction. However the burgers and fries were near stone cold. I removed the bun 'lid' to microwave the burgers and so glad I did and not just bite into them as the lettuce was absolutely disgusting. Lettuce does wilt with the heat of the burgers but this lettuce was brown and a dirty yellow rotted lettuce, the chicken royale burger was overcooked and looked re cooked actually. I checked the fries and they looked stone cold, and 'dehydrated' old(how they look if you leave them till next day dehydrated) old. I was so angry I launched the burgers and fries in the bin. Then I decided to do a review where normally I would just leave it but... because I launched them in the bin forcefully they splattered into a complete mess so I couldn't add a photo to back up what I am saying. If this is their usual standard of hygiene and food safety I will never eat from Elder Gate Burger King."

burger-king.de,1,I visited the Burger King outlet in Edinburgh Waverley station on Saturday 24 May 2025 at approx 9.45 pm. I was in a hurry for a train home and quickly ordered a spicy mayo king chicken and paid £8.78. The order arrived and I quickly made my way to my train. On opening the wrapper it was obvious that the meal was cold! I took a bite but it was not edible! I tried to make Burger King aware of my experience on their feedback form but it will not allow me to enter the time of my purchase on the App! This might seem a trivial complaint but I have supported Burger King for many years and never felt so let down!Why do they make it so difficult to raise concerns on the App? I’ll maybe think twice next time !! Need to do better BK!Iain Gentles
burger-king.de,5,Wonderful food. Excellent quality of meat. Helpful. Service and very affordable.
burger-king.de,3,"food is very good but the two management faults:1) they copy coupons from quarter to quarter. I Informed them and criticized it sharply. They are many different burgers in their offer and they will start to give coupons for them as well.  Not only copy this all standard burgersIf not, they will be giving coupons muss less frequent, only during some period throughout the year.Strange that no germans before noticed it and complained. Now coupons will be for all burger as rotation throughout the year2)the vagueness and uncertainty  about redeeming each single coupon multiple  times.  It is not defined if I can redeem for example 1 x Whopper Junior for 2,99€  let's say 4 times in one go.  Some restaurants accept it without difficulties but some refused to give more burgers. It will be also rapidly solved by burger king management in Germany"

burger-king.de,1,"Good day. We have been using Burger King services for a long time. In Ukraine, everything was fine, in Spain, the service was just awful. From support operators to the staff at the establishment, 5/5 was some  failure. Yesterday, my wife and I ordered an order through the Glovo service (they also don’t pay every time). Yesterday, they simply didn’t deliver our order, we waited for 2 hours, the operators called Burger King (no one picked up the phone), they couldn’t tell us where the order was and when it would be, no one could answer us anything except (wait, wait, it will be soon). They couldn’t cancel the order and return the money to us. The delivery was confirmed in the application, but no one delivered the order to us. Today, the establishment told us (call Glovo, it’s all their fault). Glovo also writes on Burger King"

burger-king.de,1,Recently visited several locations in my Rochester NY area for the poorly advertised Adam's family combo.I was charged a total of $49 just to confirm the actual items I wanted. No substitute option and cashier purposely allowed a standard order never verified fries or onion rings so of course she missed my requested churro fries and shake of which I thought was the point of the combo. I had both manager and assistant manager offer everything but to reduce the cost of the interaction. Upon my leaving the store both managers choose to pick up tools to repair a door. I opted for a second exit and was screamed at by the manager and told I could come her way and she would give me her corporate manager number. NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN AND LOOKING TO FURTHER ESCALANTE THE MATTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS.

burger-king.de,1,"We ordered through their web site and was assigned Order No. 50.  Ten minutes later when I arrived, it was not ready.  When I asked how long it might take, they informed me they did not have an Order # 50.  I asked them to search for it and they did find it but it had not been posted.  They then posted it but 50 minutes later, no order was ready.  When I demanded an answer form the Manager, she found the order on the floor.  Five minutes later, I had my order.  It was apparent that Burger King was trying to had to handle more customers than their crew could handle and many mistakes were made.  As I waited for my order, I witnessed a dozen different people complaining that their order wasn't correct.  It was painfully obvious that the young crew trying to service s many people were not properly prepared to undertake such a large undertaking.  Management needs to provide additional training to the crew and find ways to SUCCESSFULLY managed such large crowds."
burger-king.de,1,"I was watching the guy prepare customers and my orders omg with no gloves the way he was holding the bun and then place the lettuce etc I was not happy at all. I had to explain to the manager that was unacceptable but then to another customer who was raising the same concern as me, he said to her no one in Burger King wears gloves. Well if your handling food hair and beard nets and gloves should be worn all the time."

burger-king.de,3,I felt like this place was trying too hard. The tofu dish tasted spongy and a bit bland. The service wasn't that good and the waitress was tired. This place deserves its very average rating.
burger-king.de,1,We stopped off at services as we were hungry so thought we'd get a burger. I ordered a XXL Bacon double cheeseburger and when she told me it was over £9 I couldn't believe it! I thought I'd give it a try as it has been a while and I was so hungry... When it came it was tiny and looked like something from a kids meal! The burgers were as thin as my ex girlfriend and they looked like large scabs! No dressing at all and the bacon was as dry as my father. Absolutely discusting and it has gone down hill so much! Total waste of my money and the taste was awful! I'll resort to eating my hand next time as that would probably be tastier.

burger-king.de,1,"Concerning ONLY the Franchisee restaurant on Pass Road, Biloxi, Miss. at the Pass Rd. Gate area of Keesler AFB!This exact location has been a ‘usual’ dine stop for the past near a year, being immediately outside a Keesler AFB gate. I had no issues until, without warning nor ANY attempt to advertise or explain a full-dollar ADDED to the 2 Big Kings for $5 National pricing. So, couple weeks ago, I wondered why a $6 charge, and explored to locate what happened, on my own.Today, the same lackluster service took it all up a ‘dozen notches.’The ‘manager’ was absolutely racially-disparaging to me, and a fellow White potential customer, unrelated and full stranger to me, named Jerry FELT it as well!He is a local. He stated this location is VERY unkind, relentless in anti-White disparaging, and uncaring.Many instances to him, he explained.I drove 2 hours and wanted to use their dine-in today, for I actually had a real distressing need to urinate. Being 53 and diabetic, disabled… it comes with my ‘territory.’ Locked doors. Posted ONLY are the hours for legal dining (dine-in, drive-thru). Dine room has been open for months. Hours posted include 6am open dining area Monday-Saturday! At around 7:20am locked. Got an open door by young employee, who simply stated they were closed and we all could use the Drive-Thru. She was immediately uncomfortable when I said they are actually open, that I needed to use the restroom after a 2 hour drive, and to order breakfast. She repeated one more time, then was shoo-ed away by a 35-45 year old Black female manager.This ignorant person chose to add that they were waiting on a few workers. I stated, 3rd time, needed restroom (drove 2 hours, was gonna order B-fast after restroom use, etc…).She stated the ‘worker short blurb’ before closing the door on us while I was still reiterating the ‘legality of hours’ and even asking if I could JUST use restroom and then go order from car after!I already immediately contacted BK HQ and started an incident. I also now am never using this location again.Suggest you all consider the same resolve!"

We had our usual Whopper and fries and the whole sandwich just tasted a little off and they left off the extra onion.

burger-king.de,2,Burger Roulette is cheating roulette. You get the same burger every time. You will NEVER know what you got until you collect.ALL Burger Roulette must happened in front of you but they simply give you something cannot sell!
burger-king.de,1,"BURGER KING 1a-1b Tottenham Court Road BranchAVOIDTried to use Gents before picking up a coffee and questioned by a female member of staff in the last 20mins (approx 13:30 on 1st September) who was accusing in her tone and obstructive with her body language.This resulted in our having a debate about ordering first before using the bathroom which is located at the entrance staircase. I explained that I was on my own and didn’t want to have to take a drink in to the toilet. She refused to allow me to use the staircase and inferred that customers can’t be trusted to use the bathrooms first, they must place their order first even if they need to use the toilet!"
burger-king.de,5,"I dont understand the bad reviews... This food is actually really good, sometimes better than mc-donalds in some ways. The milkshake is really good. The bacon cheese burgers are only a dollar and they are sooooo goood. They also have nuggets, which i think are better than mcdonalds but i like a more crummy skin then a solid on. Its like a more real chicken compared to mcdonalds. (its still not real chicken but its more than mcdonalds) I really recommend this place"
burger-king.de,1,"the worst burger I ever had, should have better went and had some McD"
burger-king.de,3,I had a wopper recently and it just is not what it used to be.
burger-king.de,3,"; I kinda enjoy Burger King and I like that the burgers a lot bigger than they used to be. No kidding when my dad went to order at this place (family food stop) the employees started scream arguing to each other over their dominance of making burgers or something. I swear she was ready to fist fight her. The cashier was yelling, the kitchen was. They were fine to us but… uh not a great neighborhood I guess. Why do they fight so much lol"
burger-king.de,1,"Ordered our evening meal, starving, refused payment in cash?My father (77) and I both went hungry tonight as was late, too late to find somewhere else. Thanks burger King, won't see you again"
burger-king.de,1,"Went to Burger King today, and ordered a whopper and a medium onion ring. As soon as I got home, ready to eat my food. My onion rings were so dang hard, I almost chipped a tooth trying to bite it. I throw them at the wall, and it made a hard rock sound. Paid my money for someone to give me old, cold food. So pissed!!!!!"
burger-king.de,1,Soggy chicken royal with limp soggy lettuce and curled up dry edged cheese slice. Looked as if it had been thrown together! Had to put stuff back into the bun! Gave up after a few bites. Disgusting! Oh and the half cup of flat white coffee !! Asked if I may have it filled and was told oh that's the way it comes! No way!! That half cup was nasty too. Now I know why I gave up on junk food!!! So shocked I only took pic of half cup coffee and not the other thing. Shame on you burgerking medway services.
burger-king.de,5,"Burgers are awesome! Thought they were kidding when were asked for the done-ness of the patty. Really well grilled and cheese is beautifully melted. There are a few sides available as well. Super value for money, especially if u take up the happy hours meals. Loved it!"
burger-king.de,5,"As far as fast food goes, BK is the best of them all. Delicious burgers that are actually big, onion rings are a really good extra, and their deserts are amazing aswell."
burger-king.de,5,I like Stack House burger very much! And onion rings.

burger-king.de,5,Absolut love those burgers from burger king. Just is the king of all burgers. Great fast food in all aspects. Recommended.
burger-king.de,1,"Awful. I ordered a spicy bean burger meal at 8.38pm with onion rings instead of fries. The delivery time kept changing to a later time until it eventually arrived 30 minutes later than originally stated. I got fries instead of onion rings which were cold. The burger was squashed and the bun soggy, this was also luke warm. I paid £11.28 for this disgusting so called meal. Needless to say, I will not be ordering again."
burger-king.de,1,"Family of 5 waste of our money23 mile rd burgerking in chesterfield michigan gave me the worse food i ever tasted in carryout. Everything was old fries old and cold, cold dried up nuggets was suppose to be 10 piece they gave my son 6. cold hamburgers all the food was old even the bread was staIe. I called up there 3 mins after receiving my food they reply we gave you fresh food. Then stated you can come back we remake your order, they ask for my name and i gave them it but decided not to  travel back.  Now another issue i feel was like a insult they tried pretending we didn't give you old food lie. I use to work in fast food restaurant so im well aware so nope im never going back"
burger-king.de,1,"I went to the one in Prenzlauer Berg by Landsberger Allé station. The service was absolutely horrible! They forgot to pack half our food, let use wait till the other part got cold, and one of them picked her nose at the register. Non of them wore mask despite of corona."
burger-king.de,1,Just terrible terrible food and no quality. I ordered two whopper juniors with fries.The food actually stunk and the fries were almost black in color.Threw it all out. Never again will I attempt to eat their garbage!!!!Just trash!!!
burger-king.de,1,I’ve stopped going to Burger King on Schofield Ave in Stevens Point. They are rude and not ONE time was my order correct. I stopped leaving the drive thru until I checked my bag. I knock on the window waving to get them to come back to give me my missing items and they stand there ignoring you. 🖕
burger-king.de,5,I can say that the french fries was very good. I really love the Whooper Burger and I would liek to try again. The menu was good also.
burger-king.de,4,love the chilli-cheese bites and pepsi all the way
burger-king.de,5,"Honest, Helpful, and Constructive"
burger-king.de,2,Burger King at here in USA was not a bigger disappointment than in Europe. I regret why I chosen them again on my vacations.
burger-king.de,3,"Honestly, I dont think BK is the king of the burgers"
burger-king.de,5,"Great fast food place, I appreciate the customer service and the pricing matter a lot. Recommending the place to everyone!"
burger-king.de,1,I purchased a food from Burger King in Newquay a few days ago but didn’t open it until I got back to the hotel. Both the top of the bun and the bottom were covered in blue mould making my food inedible.The fact that the staff didn’t even notice when preparing the food was unbelievable.I have contacted the company with photos on social media but I still haven’t heard from them
burger-king.de,4,"Of course, fast food is not the best option for every day, but sometimes it allows you to eat quickly and have fun, because it is always clean, fast and tasty in its own way. The main thing is not to come here too often after all... It can be bad for your health and your shape..."
burger-king.de,5,Quality service. Good tasty burger.
burger-king.de,4,"Good food, Good priceokay service"
burger-king.de,2,Two stars.....First star for the sandwiches! Because once you get those damn things the first bite will have you coming bk next time no matter what.....obviously! Second Star is because every time we go WITHOUT FAIL we are asked to move up to wait for our food which didn’t take long to figure out that corporate times how long car sit in the drive thru so that’s how they bypass that. I’ve started to refuse to pull forward especially since 9 times outta 10 there are no cars behind you. It would be different if we were holding up the folks behind us in line.
burger-king.de,1,I DIDN'T ORDER FOOT FUNGUS ON MY BURGERRRR! >:(
burger-king.de,1,"Went to a Burger King outlet and seeing as I don’t consume meat I asked them for 5 cheeseburgers, chips, and ice cream but I said I didn’t want the em at patty’s inside the cheeseburgers but instead of listening they decided to urinate in the burger buns and threaten to unload a log in my mouth if I don’t eat it. Safe to say absolutely disgusting"
burger-king.de,1,Been to multiple burger Kings and all the same. Tell them what you want on your sandwich and get what advertised on it and the Mayo is thick like paste come on pay attention. Ordered chicken sandwich and it was ice cold in middle. Check your temps before someone gets sick. Also the taste of the beef Patty needs to cut back on the broiled taste lately it's been strong over powers everything. Took bite had to spit out leaves after taste.
burger-king.de,1,The problem is not the food but the people who are working at the place. Now my experience here is bad all the time I have seen employees smash the burger now you not fixing your burger you are fixing someone else's burger. Now the burgers are dry food be cold just the burger king I been too in a while.
burger-king.de,3,I have had good and bad expereice with them. they are jsut ok
burger-king.de,5,"Excellent fries, becareful you may have hired some spitters at a few of your locations."
burger-king.de,1,"I have travelled to multiple countries and have always had Burger King (my go-to fastfood). For some reason the burger patties in Germany taste really lame. I have tried 3 times already, same waste of money everytime. Hopefully they can change their burger patties to the ones from the US."
burger-king.de,3,not bad. it can be better
burger-king.de,3,I bought food from them but they did not deliver on time. A little dissapointed
burger-king.de,1,"I bought food from burger king Slough town centre and saw my statement a month latter and they have charged me twice £27.24.When I ask for my refund they   have promised if I prove on bank statement they will refund it.I provided them with my two transactionsAnd now the regional Abhishek said that this is not enough.I am willing to take this further if they are not sorting it out as soon as possible.The manager Henry and they regional were involve but they could check the day that I had purchase to see if it was banking over.I am not even given them a one star .I am going to citizens bureau on Friday and seek advise then take action.I would not trust them at all. I would recommend KFC and MacDonald all day along,I was having conversations with The store but they were interested to see my banking application and they refused it then Email the regional the banking statement which he specifically ask for exact detail and they reject it.It would be appreciated that if someone from head office call me on mobile to discuss this further."
burger-king.de,5,My family loves Burger King especially my 11 year old son. Our restaurant is always clean and everybody is super friendly. The price of there food is fantastic and it is delicious.Our restaurant is 7310 Veterans Parkway
burger-king.de,4,I love their burgers...But i think the price is not reflects the quaility.
burger-king.de,2,Their burgers have gotten worse over the years. Ate there last week and will not come back in a long time. They need to focus on quality over quantity!
burger-king.de,3,"I am an avid consumer of the Whopper,  have been for a long time.  Now I am having trouble understanding how  Burger King justifies advertising a Taco with photos of tacos that have no connection to the $1 product being sold.  The Taco shown in their ads is an outright lie and bears no resemblance to the taco product being sold."
burger-king.de,5,I love burger give me more burger nom nom roar EEEEEso I come in burger king and I eat burger it good
burger-king.de,5,It Save me when am hungry after work
burger-king.de,1,"I used to think they were okay, but I will never go there again because they used their Twitter account to encourage violence against MEP candidates. McDonald's stopped selling milkshakes in some areas because they'd been thrown over several candidates, so Burger King tweeted that they are still selling them in a clear attempt to say don't worry, we will supply you with ammunition. If there was any doubt, it vanished when they subsequently like a tweet by someone encouraging this behaviour."
burger-king.de,1,I was so exited about going to my local burger king for the first time but... so basically I ordered a whopper and one of your employees defecated in my burger I am not happy and expect a full refund
burger-king.de,1,"My son, my husband, and myself went to get some lunch and sat and waiting for our order to come up. It was very very busy at this time so when they called our number we went to get the food. The lady behind the counter was very rude asking I need to see your receipt or you don’t get your food! Before we even got our food I sat there watching everyone pick up their food with no receipt in hand and her having no problems with giving them their food! But I think the main reason she put up a fight with us and giving us a hard time because at that time in the whole restaurant my family was the only white people there. I didn’t want to think this was about race but unfortunately it was. That’s uncalled for especially towards my child! I hope this gets back to corporate and hopefully get in touch with this place! This Burger King is located in Gainesville ga the address is 403 pearl nix pkwy."
burger-king.de,5,That was pretty good food i like the taste and service we injoy it
burger-king.de,2,"I used to eat in burger king almost every day, until I got sick. I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to feel good after your lunch"
burger-king.de,1,"Does this company try to hire the rudest people they can find? The Alabaster Al location certainly does. They never say thank you and if they say anything it's just ""here"", when they hand you the bag in the drivethrew"
burger-king.de,5,Food that you get fast and eat fast too! Frequent buyer.
burger-king.de,1,"The food is hot and delicious but the workers work too slow especially during busy times. Some workers also don’t understand English, which makes it difficult to order what I want."
burger-king.de,3,"I was in Germany and tried your burger, I liked it, but at McDonald's the burgers are more delicious. :))))"
burger-king.de,5,I like it very much! (Сам Отзыв)
burger-king.de,4,The order was delivered quickly and taste was great!
burger-king.de,1,"Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4chaner uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: ""This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King."" Admittedly, he had shoes on.But that's even worse.The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4chaner. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's ""Tell us about us"" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said ""Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired."" Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace."

The staff are ignorant & the burgers are undercooked with strange bits on top of them, when you inform the staff they question you, disbelieve you when the proof is right there infront of them! Has really put me off burger king for life."
burger-king.de,1,"The Burger King fast food chain in Russia has taken down an ad depicting a 17-year-old victim of rape and beating. It comes after social media users clashed over Diana Shurygina’s case – some supporting her, others saying the rape never happened.On Tuesday evening, Burger King posted the image on its page in the Russian social network Vkontakte, showing a girl with the haircut and clothes Shurygina wore on a TV talk show where she told of her ordeal.The underage Shurygina was allegedly raped at a party, with the 21-year-old perpetrator Sergey Semyonov sentenced to eight years behind bars (the sentence was later reduced to three years). Many Vkontakte users blamed the victim, saying she provoked Semyonov or outright lied about the rape. There are around 25,000 supporters in the group supporting him, and about 10,000 in the group set up to support the girl.On the Burger King poster, the girl makes the same gesture she used on the show to indicate how much vodka she had drunk before the assault: “Just a little.”© Leonhard FoegerIn the ad, it seems to mean that the special offer – buy one burger, get one free – “won’t last long.”Following the posting, users began to express their indignation with the Burger King social network managers.“This is the last straw, I'm not buying their food again,” one of the more moderate Facebook comments goes. Other reactions ranged from an astonished “What the ****?” to calling the advert's authors ******** jerks.”Some users say the wrote emails to Burger King's US headquarters to have the ad taken down, though there's no indication they ultimately affected the decision.The ad was eventually taken down, with no reason given. There has been no official statement from Burger King so far.It is not the first time this story has been used over the last two months, though. The media outlet Life posted an ad saying their website has news and “a little bit of memes,” referring to Diana’s gesture about the vodka."
burger-king.de,4,"Southend burger king,food is awful,but I visit because BIG Lucy works there,her buns are second to none.Also what she can do to my meat is amazing,its always covered in sauce when she handles it.Guys if your served by BIG Lucy,she guarantees you will have a big whopper every time."
burger-king.de,1,"What has happened to burger king,, me and my grandchildren visited the trinity retail park branch in bolton.It is the pits, the food is over priced , cold and the staff i think they got them from ,, hire a moron.Don't fall for the free wopper if you give your feedback on the internet.You will find in the small print, the free wopper is free if you pay £1.79 for a standard fries, which is the same size as the 99p one from McdonaldsAnd also you have to pay £1.79 for a watery drink.I ask to speak to the manager to discuss the cold food, he came and he looked like he needed a dam good wash and his clothes needed removing and burning.If you are going to treat your family this weekend,  do yourself a favour and go to mc donalds.  Burger king.......you should be ashamed."
burger-king.de,1,Stay away from the Clacton factory outlet Branch. The food is disgraceful and the place looks down right dirty. Massive long queues. One person taking orders and serving and then when staff to appear they are  arguing by the till point.
burger-king.de,5,Love the cheese burgers. One of my fav fast food chains :)
burger-king.de,1,Nasty. Burger king is so disgusting. Also I worked there twice. If people knew long the good stays in the warmers they would not eat it. Stay away far away! !

burger-king.de,1,After a recent visit to the mk branch I found the staff very rude and unhelpful they threw my order out of the window and shut it when I asked for sauce they spoke to me through the glass totaly unprofessional get some staff that want to work rather than some one who just wants to get some money

www.wendys.com,1,"Haven’t had a Wendy’s in years but decided to try a cheeseburger today. The main thing I could taste was the salad. The meat was so thin that I thought it was embarrassed to be amongst so much vegetation. The only thing I got from the meat was salt. That would’ve been fine if any meat taste would’ve accompanied it. The roll was just slightly better than the dry, cardboard offerings that Burger King offer…but only just. Wendy’s get your directors to eat one of these in place of their 5 star boardroom lunches and see if their mouths and tastebuds reject this extremely poor effort.There’s a drain in Southend that has just nom nom’d the £2.49 I’ve parted with!"

www.wendys.com,2,We visited the Whitby branch today and it wasn’t busy.We abandoned our first choice of table because it wasn’t cleaned.Person assembling food was not wearing protective gloves.The burger ( unlike every other Wendy’s I’ve eaten )was tepid rather than hot.The toilet was smelly and in need of a good clean ( especially the sink.
www.wendys.com,1,"I recently came across a disturbing video on Facebook that depicted a manager exhibiting extreme rudeness and disrespect towards an employee who had dedicated over 37 years of service to the company. The video further revealed that the employee’s hourly wage was a mere $13.00. As a result of this experience, I have resolved to refrain from patronizing Wendy’s restaurants in the future."

www.wendys.com,1,"At peterborough in UK yesterday approx 2130hrs placed order at drive through. Screen showed different order. Changed it but staff reluctant to do so. Drive to pick up window. Meal provided different again, more expensive and told “meal deals not available at drive in, all items individually priced” even though meals are shown on your price board. Not impressive. Left meal and drive away. I am hardly a reactionary- I am a middle aged man and I am not prone to rash outbursts. I have enjoyed Wendy’s since your first foray to the UK several years ago having come across your excellent products in the US. If this is your new price gouging and service strategy then I regret I am not impressed"
www.wendys.com,4,"Today, I had my first experience with Wendy's breakfast. I was impressed. I only ordered a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit but it was good. The cheese was melted and the egg was a real egg. I am very pleased."

www.wendys.com,5,very good very good burger amazing
www.wendys.com,4,i believe that their service was at a top standard and i think they deserve more money for how hard they work for.8/10 customer service
www.wendys.com,1,20 minutes for food to be greeted by a sloth type person who had no energy or give a poop about service.The rare burger was gooey and not the best taste.This site has been the worst experience and considering I live 5 mins away it's not worth the effort.Drinks where good.
www.wendys.com,1,Wendys in Smyrna Tennessee on Sam Ridley has the worst person working in that place. He works in the morning as a cook and has bad angry issues.  I was scared when he brought my food to the car I threw it away. I didn’t trust he had done something to it and I felt so uneasy around him. This was the third encounter I seen his anger for ordering food he did not want to cook. Beware of this place
www.wendys.com,1,"We regularly eat at Wendy’s with the 130th Avenue location in Calgary being our go to. No longer! F9r the last month, there have been errors in our order, the most serious being ingredients we specifically requested NOT be on the burger as our child has allergies.Despite the fact that even the receipt shows NO ingredients as specified were to be added, they continued to be on each order.When I wrote to Wendy’s head office, they had the local manager Nareen of the location at 130th Ave call me. She promised me a free meal for the family next time we came.When we went to the restaurant, she became very belligerent and stated she had not promised a free meal. She further lied and said I had called her when in fact, she called, head office had given her my phone number to call me.Not only have they endangered my children through their carelessness multiple times but then subjected us to belligerence and rude behaviour in front of other customers.Corporate Wendy’s needs to ensure their franchisees provide a modicum of customer service. This location at 130th Ave Calgary excels only in being the worst.Eat anywhere but at Wendy’s."
www.wendys.com,1,DO NOT TRUST THE APP.  App may create duplicate orders and steal money.  You may also get charged for orders when you get an email saying that the order did not go through and has been cancelled.  the website complaint system is a joke too.  Painful scum company to deal with.
www.wendys.com,1,Ordering from Wendy's was a total waste of my money. I don't think it's fair or within consumer standards to sell burgers without buns and half-filled milkshakes. It seems like they are purposely ripping people off. I will never order from them again.
www.wendys.com,5,"great food, value for money. would recommend."
www.wendys.com,1,Crooked people.  Awning came off of their Wendy's.  They have a shill insurance company.  Manager told me he would take care of me.  Now I have 2000 dollars of damage and these wealthy grubbers won't pay for the damage.  The awning was not fastened down yet their insurance says it was an accident and they aren't liable.  News to me.   I guess the judge will hear it since they won't make it right.    Zero communication and zero integrity in their leadership.
www.wendys.com,1,The lady intentionally kept shutting her headset off when I was trying to order. And then I proceeded to pull up and you could hear she was actually talking crap about me for a lady I didn't even know. And then proceeded to not even give me my full order which wasn't very much it was two sandwiches one large fry and a baked potato. As much as I love Wendy's and the spicy chicken sandwich I will not be going back to that location. Management actually needs to seriously look at their staff.
www.wendys.com,5,"Good customer service, top quality food. Would come again."
www.wendys.com,1,The Wendy’s located in Ahoskie n.c on memorial drive needs to be shut down!!! The worker Debrian needs to take classes in the job field or just go to school. Very disrespectful and unkept and a disservice to the company
www.wendys.com,5,"Wendy’s hamburgers are consistently fresh and flavorful, with their signature square patties giving them a unique edge over typical fast-food burgers. The beef tastes juicy and well-seasoned, and the toppings are usually crisp and fresh. They strike a nice balance between quality and fast service, making them a solid choice when you want something more satisfying than the average drive-thru burger."
www.wendys.com,1,"Dreadful. The chips were cool, not evem ht.The cheeseburger was actually chilled!The food is not made to order but made, chill;ed and microwaved it would seem.Mine missed the microwave i guess.I used Wendys in the USA and it was better there than MacDonalds.I wont go to the wendys in the UK again"
www.wendys.com,5,"Such a fantastic burger bar Straight forward touch Menus and easy to pay. Plenty of seats and the atmosphere is lovley and peaceful. Quick, professional service when collecting our food which tasted extremely yummy!"
www.wendys.com,5,experience was great great service from kinase southend on  sea
www.wendys.com,2,Wow portions are small.. even when “medium” ordered.Asked for a lettuce “bun” replacement.. two small bits of lettuce on top and underneath.. looked ridiculous!
www.wendys.com,5,"Very good food, very good service. Really nice servers."
www.wendys.com,5,Cheap nice food
www.wendys.com,1,Going inside and standing at the counter to have no one say a word to me for 3 min. I didn't stick around any longer then that.
www.wendys.com,5,"Fresh, love the frostys.Friendly good customer service from aaron"
www.wendys.com,5,"Lovely food, amazing service"
www.wendys.com,5,"Love the menu prices, food, drinks & frosty. Some associates attitudes can be improved upon, but most are warm and inviting. Have to say if I were to give a sub par review on this platform the initial Wendy's quote would be ""What happened this time"" now that would be some of the attitudes I speak of. Other than that the restaurant was clean and bathrooms were okay at best. Have to say passing out Wendy coupons for BOGO on the already 1.00 breakfast biscuits is great, but if none of the associates except the coupon and the coupon expires July 31st, that is shaddy and not cool. All in all thanks for this customer to comment on this platform for others to see unless the company decides to delete this message."
www.wendys.com,3,"Recently I've bin in one of the Wendy's restaurants and tasted their Burgers. To be honest the meet was dry in burger, i should've go for chicken burger. As for the French fries, it is yummy. Overall, food was edible."
www.wendys.com,5,Very nice lady
www.wendys.com,1,today I went to Wendy's restaurant  #00007635 in clemmons nc 27012we order 2 for 7 dollar spicy sandwich and free medium fries with 10 pc spicy nuggets.I am very disappointed first time this type of food they sold sandwich half cook and raw sandwich both not only one sandwich. and fries is to cold . even i told them I can wait just give me hot food but it was cold .  when I call them manager first hand up on me I called again they said I m busy I told them ok let me call health department.  they act they dont care.I rate this 1 star I m not satisfied

www.wendys.com,1,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent experience at your Spalding branch.I placed an order for three large Frostyccinos and proceeded to collect it via the drive-thru. Upon arrival, I provided my order number, only to be told I needed to come inside to collect it. This was highly inconvenient, especially as it was raining heavily. I found this request unreasonable, having chosen the drive-thru for convenience and to avoid the bad weather.After I refused to leave my vehicle, a staff member eventually brought the order out, which I appreciated. However, this situation was frustrating and confusing, and I would like a clear explanation as to why my order could not be fulfilled through the drive-thru as expected.Additionally, the drinks I received were clearly just iced coffees, not the Frostyccinos advertised and paid for. They lacked the frosty vanilla blend and were a disappointment.To make matters worse, I attempted to raise this issue online but was unable to do so. Your feedback form required details from a physical receipt, which I never received. The online receipt I received did not contain the required information, preventing me from submitting my complaint through that channel. I have attached the available order details.I also attempted to call the Spalding restaurant directly to speak to someone about the issue. I was told to leave a message and that someone would get back to me—but I have not received any follow-up to date.Given the incorrect order, poor service, and failed attempts to raise the issue, I respectfully request a refund or a voucher to replace the drinks I originally ordered. I also ask for clarification on your drive-thru procedures and your complaint system's limitations. I have emailed this to customer support and got absolutely no response. Appalling customer service!!!Update- on the 24th of July customer service sent me an email to ask if I had a Wendy's app and that they would send me some money there as compensation and asked me to confirm my email address, although it was the one they were emailing me on ... It is now the 6th of August and still I've got no reply at all. Not going to Wendy’s in Spalding ever again!"
www.wendys.com,1,"we went there to grab a bite to eat, we sat at the speaker for more than 5 minutes. When we pulled up to the speaker no-one was there before us or after we just got there. looked at menu and decided what we wanted, waited for someone to take our order, no-one came. We said hello into the speaker 3 times, no response, we even honked our horn, nothing. Left 4 cars were waiting, no-one at windows either, we are very upset, something needs to be done about this. BTW the store only had 1 customer, so I don't know what excuse they can use."

www.wendys.com,5,"First time trying Wendy’s and I’m very impressed! The food was made to order, it was hot and very tasty. The restaurant was clean and cool. I liked that I could personalise my cold drink which is a nice edge over other fast food restaurants. The training manager was in today and he came over to check how the food was and when I explained this was my first ever Wendy’s he let me know about other locations near me and offered me a free Frosty! Delicious. I’ll definitely be back!"
www.wendys.com,1,I went to my local Wendy's yesterday for breakfast I usually order the very same item from the breakfast menu number 3 And I've never had an issue until now. The potato wedges wishes really the reason why I go there they are awesome but this time around there was no potato! I bit through the overly deep fried wedge only to find a hollow interior and could not chew the extremely tough wedge that did not even resemble or taste like a potato!I didn't bother to go back because I had errands to run but I felt like I didn't have breakfast. So so disappointed
www.wendys.com,5,Great service and Burgers again. Best burgers in Derby.
www.wendys.com,5,"Great service. Brilliant food, cheap prices, nice people, great overall shop"
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy's 655 Solon OhioI was treated so rudely on my visit today 6/29th around 2:30 pm.Upon receiving our drive thru order of a junior bacon cheeseburger and Parmesan caesar salad and 2 drinks only 1  straw was given,We waited until the window opened again and said we needed a second straw, the gentleman said they need a second straw and this African American young women with long braids said there are 2 straws in the salad bag look! She had an attitude and I can't believe over a straw and not just handing us a second one. I had already done that of course.I then proceeded to take everything out of my salad bag in my car and turn the bag over and 2nd straw my ass.She then said I don't know who you think you are and don't start profanities with me(sorry ass is not a profanity), I said you insisted the 2nd straw was in the bag.She said the 2nd straw was in the bag, It fell out somewhere and I don't care. Get off my property.Really over asking for a second straw you didn't get, you get attitude over it, instead of just giving one. Telling a customer you don't care and get off my property?What a vile experience at this Wendy's in Solon Ohio 655"
www.wendys.com,5,Manager  Paul knows people and treats everyone  nicely fairly and without discrimination.He is particularly good to seniors  and makes them feel welcome and specialWe love wendy sWe love the quality food not like the processed manure of mcdonald's.

www.wendys.com,2,Visited Wendy's in Wisbech today. Hottest day of the year so far and was greeted by a heatwave. Asked the staff why was there no air conditioning and was informed it was broken. The staff were absolutely sweating but really helpful me and my partner felt so sorry for them. 5 stars for the staff but 1 Star for the shop conditions. Won't be going back until air conditioning is fixed. Such a shame.

www.wendys.com,3,"Tried wendy's at spalding today. What  a disappointment.We got large with not eating all day, very small portions. Got hair on my chip and they tasted of old grease and got started with my burger that was the same full of grease and not very hot, that is all we could teast. Cost £30 for 2 of us we could only manage half. We will never be visiting again."

www.wendys.com,1,"The staff called a number, I heard it as 5287 but it was 5285.However when I took the order, he didn't check my number. I started eating with chips. when I opened my burger I found out that it was with bacon, I ordered with chicken. I returned it and apologized as it was my faultas well. But another staff started moaning, he made me look like a was trying to steal the burger or like I am stupid. I apologized again and offered to pay for the wrongorder. He refused but still was very rude to me. He made really uncomfortable infront of other customers so i couldn't even eat my own food. And I had to leave paying for the food which I couldn't eat, staying hungry."
www.wendys.com,1,"Terrible!!! not only was the food terrible from past experience, decided to give it another try again and the service was terrible not only did they cancel my order for no apparent reason they had me wait an hour for nothing. would not recommend"
www.wendys.com,1,There was some white sticky substance in my burger this is not skibidi 🤢
www.wendys.com,5,Had Wendy's at Watford today the food was great and the staff were so nice to my family and me Well Done
www.wendys.com,1,Cash is legal tender. Accept it or I won’t be visiting.
www.wendys.com,5,"Wendy's food leaves the competition at the starting line! I really enjoy Wendy's as a treat. The burgers are nicely put together too, not a sloppy mess like you might find elsewhere. I go to the Wendy's at Barlborough, Chesterfield and the staff are polite and Ryan gets a special mention for being very welcoming. The dining area was reasonably clean too. The food is fresh and decent quality. I just hope they keep up the high standards."
www.wendys.com,1,The Wendy’s on 30th st in Canton Ohio is the slowest location I have ever been to by far. If you go there just go ahead and and go behind the counter and make your own meal I promise it will be faster. Everyone just stands around playing on their Phone. EVEN THE MSNAGER. Very unprofessional. I even decline to pick up door dash from here because it’s so slow.
www.wendys.com,4,Good service and great variety of burgers
www.wendys.com,1,"Food descriptions and allergies access was not clear or easy to find - no access via the touch screens (that was clear anyway) which is the main source of ordering.   Quality of food was disgusting!!!!!!   Ordered a wrap, it was soggy and cold.  Plus really small.   Not good value for money.  Would not recommend  We also ordered a burger.... SOOOOO SALTY.  Only one toilet in a large restaurant.  You have to queue for a long time.  No wash basin or sanitation facilities to clean hands before eating.   Bring back to covid days!!!  At least things were clean!!!"
www.wendys.com,3,"Visited Spalding branch , ordered at 9.10 pm ,went to collect order and she said we couldn't eat in and had to take out ,why didn't the machine I ordered on tell  me this and they close at 9.30 pm , ridiculous closing at that time."
www.wendys.com,1,"I visited the Wendy’s in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and sadly, it was a letdown from start to finish. The service was slow, and when my food finally arrived, the burger was so greasy, even the bun was soaked through. It was so bad I couldn’t eat it and ended up throwing it away.I ordered a large meal, the fries barely filled half the carton, and the drink was disappointingly small. It was closer to a McDonald’s small drink than anything “large.”For the price, I expected better quality and value. I won’t be returning and will stick to other local restaurants where the food and service actually reflect the cost."
www.wendys.com,1,"3001 e silver springs blvd Ocala Florida. My first bad expired with an almost racist white girl in the window on 1/3/2025 around 630 pm ish Ocala Florida time. She was all fine and smiles and giggles until she recognized my order and u could hear the annoyance in her voice.u would think I knew/know her previously and she was just keeping up the act but I did nothing to this girl to now feel like I can’t even go to this location anymore bc she may have told her coworkers what I get and the potential of someone to do something to my food. Id literally hate to be facing charges bc someone tried to be petty..They were proudly not wearing gloves literally scooped my (old, dried out ) chicken nuggets AND fries with no gloves then handed them to me and struggled to stuff them in the bag so I can imagine her palm grazed all over my food at some point which I didn’t eat just tossed in my local dumpster before I got home . Yes this was TODAY (5/25/2025) Like why are they so confident being so open about being nasty? You don’t know what in the world people do with their hands. This particular Wendy’s is notoriously known as the “ghetto” Wendy’s whereas even known appointed managers are famous for not caring about anything that they should. If y’all are fine with this locations keeping and living up to it’s nasty reputation then please ignore this but if you’re wondering what else they’re doing bare hands /who knows what else like it won’t be long before someone gets extremely sick or maybe another customer takes a less traditional approach to their nonchalantness for cleaniness and basic respect for human hygiene as a food service worker.. only time will tell."

www.wendys.com,5,"Great service, good hot food, pleasant staff. Very enjoyable visit"
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy’s Blackpool. I genuinely have no words for how shockingly bad this place is. Chicken wrap contained what I can only describe as severely undercooked chewy mush and was tiny. Baked potato you could have smashed a window with, swimming in watery stuff that was supposed to be cheese ? Weird and inedible. Halloumi fries- 3 of for 3 quid.  Instantly returned for a refund. Staff not at all surprised or bothered when the food came back to the counter. Ridiculously expensive absolute garbage. Avoid."
www.wendys.com,5,"I have been here twice now, in different locations. The staff are welcoming, professional and friendly, alongside the fact that everything is clean and presentable. Not even mentioning the food is incredible! Fresh, tasty and genuinely more competitively priced and better quality than any other in the industry including F.G. and will definitely visit again"

www.wendys.com,1,"Hi Wendy's,I truly wish I didn’t have to write this, especially since I’ve always appreciated the quality and passion behind your food — particularly the Baconator, which is honestly a brilliant creation. Unfortunately, the one I received from your Fulham Broadway location was a bit of a letdown.Out of respect, I didn’t raise it in-store, as I imagine the staff there may not be as familiar with the high standards Wendy’s is known for. It’s a shame, really — the Baconator I got had only one lonely slice of bacon and just ketchup, no mayo. Not quite the indulgent treat I was looking forward to.I'm not sharing this to get anything in return, and there’s no need for a photo — I just wanted to let you know, because I know what Wendy’s can be, and I miss that. Wishing you all the best and hoping the love for your food shines through a little more next time.Warm regards,"
www.wendys.com,5,great food!
www.wendys.com,2,The portions are small as per kids size overpriced for the quantity !The wrap was cold but the chicken inside was hot !Slow serving !The staff uniforms can be cleaned and ironed!The design of restaurant is looking ok !This was  in Watford !
www.wendys.com,2,Burgers were overcooked and dry and the bun was greasy on top.Avocado in salad was almost frozen and lettuce had a hard stem attached.
www.wendys.com,2,"No bean burgers, so I was left with little choice.Had the jacket potato with sour cream. It was nearly cold. Not impressed. No knife to cut it either .Maybe will give the bean burger a try if it's available next time. Otherwise won't bother.Staff ok and seemed clean so that was a bonus."
www.wendys.com,5,"Visited Wendy's in Blackpool today, food was very tasty just a little small portion wise, Amy was a very nice member of staff and she was cleaning the self serv screen which you never see anywhere, One toilet was out of use but otherwise ok."
www.wendys.com,5,"Not only was the food tasty, but Ash (at the Sheffield arena branch) took extra care in making sure my order was correct and also included a note going the extra mile and offering help if we needed anything more should we need it. I will definitely be going to this branch again and hopefully I’ll get to have Ash serve me next time for such brilliant customer service!"

They have 4 Family toilets, 2 were locked, out of order, 1 was overflowing onto the floor with everything coming out the toilet & the last one you could not sit as that was starting to block & water coming back up toilet. Everything was absolutely disgusting literally a health & safety concern. Won’t be eating there again."

www.wendys.com,1,"The food was disgusting, a horrible company 🤮🤮🤮"
www.wendys.com,1,"Yesterday my family and I decided to try Wendy's for the first time since it was new to our area. We walked in, it was empty. There were only two members of staff in the kitchen ""cooking"" the food. We ordered Two small fries + one medium, Ovocado chicken wraps, Halloumi Fries and a Jr. cheeseburger deluxe. The portion sizes are absolutely shocking. The fries were discustingly cold, the burger was sloppy, stone cold and vile, the Halloumi fries were lukewarm and last but not least, the chicken in the avocado wrap tasted like rubber and looked as if it had been left on the side for a while. My family and I are terribly disappointed. I can confidently say we will not return. The food is an absolute joke (not fresh as stated on the menu) and a total waste of money."
www.wendys.com,5,"VJ was amazing at the Portsmouth Wendy's!  He offered us such friendly service that it made it a visit we won't forget.  We loved the food too, especially the spicy chicken nuggets - yum!  Thanks!"

www.wendys.com,5,Great food extra tasty
www.wendys.com,3,"Decided to try Wendys in Southend for the first time. We ordered a double Dave burger and bacon fries each...then an extra portion of plain fries and 10 chicken nuggets to share. Takes us 30 to 40 mins for the round trip so whilst the food was delicious, the extra chips and nuggets we had paid for werent in the bag and it was too far to go back. Great food but much as you shouldnt have to (as you should be able to trust the staff to do their jobs) check your order before you leave or you may get ripped off like we did. Expensive mistake"
www.wendys.com,2,"Wendy's in Orangeburg sc need training like chick fil a. Don't care how long you wait in Drive thru.....then they would get on the microphone and tell you, it will be 30 mins before they take your order, when there's no car in front of you. Both Wendy's always out of something. They have lost a lot of customers. Everybody is complaining."
www.wendys.com,1,I hate it. I ordered Wendy’s fries and Dave’s singe. Classic chocolate frosty. But they did not have me classic vanilla’s!!!!!!!
www.wendys.com,1,"Thought we'd try Wendy's next to Macdonalds at Barlborough Derbyshire, big mistake.Small jacket potato with cheese, cheesy chips, Hallumi fries( three small, soggy and stuck together) and a cappuccino £12.The potato had that microwaved look about it as the skin wasn't crispy and there wasn't much cheese. The chips and cheese were ok but there was hardly any cheese, the cappuccino tasted ok but had no chocolate on it.Overall quality is poor and portion sizes are small for the price.These new places need to up their game. Macdonalds food is better, the menu more varied with cheaper options and it's a lot better value.We've given it a chance but won't be going back."

www.wendys.com,1,By far the crappest food I think I’ve genuinely ever tasted not worth the money at all. Wouldn’t surprise me if it shuts soon (one on the A1 near Stamford)
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy's should open up for fries as well during breakfast hours. Only potato wedges are being served during these hours. This seems forced selling. Customers are hungry for breakfast and manytimes they have no choice but to buy, This is forced selling to the customer with no or limited option."
www.wendys.com,1,"Got no napkins, had to ask for straws and ketchup.  Got attitude .."
www.wendys.com,1,"Just look at the responses from customer service to the complaints!! Zero!! Tells you everything you need to know about the service, company ethics and the food."
www.wendys.com,3,I haven't eaten at a Wendy's for a while so I decided to stop and have lunch.The cashier was very nice and friendly. I decided on having Chili. What I got wasn't  chili. I would call it Bean chili. It had so many beans in it  and no hamburger.  They need to put some meat in it along with the beans. Very disappointed. This was in Frankfort Ky.
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy’s on Figueroa in Los Angeles.Worst Wendy’s ever. They tried to charge me $3.99 for a glass of water after I spent $16 on a meal. As I watched 3 or 4 homeless people walk in, take an empty cup out of the trash, and refill it from the machine. Manager did not say anything. Really Wendy’s? I’m sure this place will close soon."
www.wendys.com,1,Visited Wendy’s on kingswood in hull and I ordered cheesy bacon fries when they arrived I was very very disappointed. They looked absolutely nothing like the picture and to be honest the tray they came in could have housed three times the amount. The picture showed a full tray and reality was a few chips in the bottom with a bit of grated cheddar cheese thrown on top and six bits of chopped bacon. Hence to say this will be my first and last visit to any Wendy’s sites.
www.wendys.com,1,Thought I would tryWendy's for the first time. Advertised a deal on website. Arrived at shop no longer doing offer. Then take it off website so annoying.
www.wendys.com,1,Order single from drive thru. Got home burger not cooked. Tried to call store and would not answer. Had to drive back and they seemed tonitcare. Gave another burger and I asked how do I know this is cooked. Was told it was personally checked. Offered nothing for my wasted time and gas. Got home and cut in half to check and wasn't cooked all the way through. Would advise anyone to check meal or not shop at the Wendy's in Bethel Park pa on library Rd. Horrible
www.wendys.com,5,Lady was nice (Kirsty)
www.wendys.com,1,I went to Wendy’s in Colchester high street today at about 12ish and I am horrified with the food I was served. I paid £19 for my order and I have photos and videos to show how disappointed I was. I ordered the cheesy chips and this is what I was served. It was cold in the middle and full of oil. The cheese was placed in a random spot and left to look like that. I’m a student on part time work and I barely earn money to buy a takeaway and when I did this is what I was served. It was freezing cold in the inside of the burger as well. The burger left the bun completely full of oil to the point it was dripping cold liquid.
www.wendys.com,1,If you can't take my order in person I WILL NOT BE BACK .
www.wendys.com,5,Went to my first Wendy's today it was lovely staff were amazing really polite and kind we really enjoyed the meal the burger fries amazing drinks were lush sometimes I get tummy aches from places like this so was bit worried to try but nope had no tummy troubles clean fresh and only this is the doors opening up alot made the place cold inside but you can't help that but will know it be more amazing in summer times so thanks  again shall be back again
www.wendys.com,5,Greeted with a smile by Kayla. Poised and communicated clearly. Stands out from her peers at the Nimmo location.
www.wendys.com,4,"Good staff, two ladies know me well, know what I'm going to order when they see me enter the store. The Manager was on her job keeping the store in tact keeping the store clean,  all items kept up and stocked and take good care of customers.😀👍 Breakfast experience"
www.wendys.com,1,"The experience was nothing like I expected. Burgers were or appeared small, the fries were in a very small container which from MacDonalds would be described as a small, child's portion, I ordered 2 large fries, LARGE being the operative word, but i ended up with a handful of chips between 2 adults.I had an avocardo wrap, with no avocardo, my friend pointed out that the little bit of green slime at the edge of the wrap was the creamy avocardo!I expected some slices of avocardo since it was the main ingredient in the wrap.(see menu)My jacket potato was stone cold! As was most of the order. And the potato was covered in a cheese that was clearly squeezed out of a plastic bottle!Drinks: latte and hot chocolate were fine.This will go down as the nastiest meal I have had as a take away delivery.I will not be visiting the store in southend, nor ordering from there again. The food and Service did not reflect what I was expecting from the USA."
www.wendys.com,1,Your prices have gone up like crazy the last couple years and your service and quality has gone down. Basically asking for more money for less quality food. It’s terrible
www.wendys.com,5,The manager at Wendy's in Russellville ar on Arkansas is the best has the best manager .she goes way above for great service...store 3057..I think name was Allison..from taking my order over phone because the online site was down to me picking order up everything was great..she deserves a raise
www.wendys.com,5,I recently visited the Wendy’s in Liverpool and was really impressed with not only the quality of the food but also the service.This place keep drawing us back time after time.
www.wendys.com,1,We came into our local Wendy's and went to order and their only two people In front of us and yet we still waited 30 minutes to order because their was no set cashier because they were constantly getting off task and helping other people that messed up significantly. They seemed under staffed and had zero sense of what was going on and after 45 minutes we were finally able to have our meal at the expense of being late to work
www.wendys.com,1,"Visited the new Colchester store today and I have never had such a disgusting experience, we got our food and sat, while eating we noticed behind us a pile of uncleaned sick on the floor. Yep, actual sick, half cleaned, right were customers eat their food!! We told staff and they still hadn't come over to clean it when we finished, absolutely disgusted and disgusting an actual health violation, I would NOT recommend to anyone!!!!"
www.wendys.com,1,The meat on my double cheeseburger was less than the meat on one single and it was overcooked.  I ordered a double cheesburger expecting 1/4 lb patties as advertised. They just lost a long time customer.
www.wendys.com,1,"Would give 0 stars if i could -  et friend for lunch, she ad broken her ankle so couldn’t walk too far - Wendys was closest for her.  Wow, sooo expensive.  Food was quick but only just warm - i suspect burgers had been cooked a while before and left out, same with the chips.  Burger was greasy and very small for what you pay.  Restaurant wasn’t that clean either - wont be going there again - very disappointed"
www.wendys.com,1,Wendy’s Whitby ukThe place is dirty food left on the floor and tables toilets dirty need a bloody good clean and the food was a disaster no way was the burger freshly cooked its texture told you that and how do you mould a lettuce and tomato into a burger if your not using a microwave?.the chicken burger was beyond bland but worst still the staff don’t seem to give a damn no interest in customers complaint they won’t being uk long if this is the standard.
www.wendys.com,5,Went to Wendy’s on high street Colchester. Food was very nice.  Very fast and workers were very friendly. Will be returning for more in the future.Daniel was very friendly aswell
www.wendys.com,1,"Review for Zion Crossroads, VA (Charlottesville, VA) location: The most abysmal experience ever in fast food restaurant service. We placed a mobile order and pulled up to the call box; there was no one else in the drive thru. We were told “We are taking a break right now for 10 minutes because we are short staffed.” without any opportunity to tell them we had already placed our order. We pulled up to window and waited for them to acknowledge us. After stating we had placed a mobile order, the manager (?) - who actually was very polite to us - shut the window and yelled out that she needed the sandwich maker back - even though there were several employees in the kitchen. There seemed to be a lot of chaos behind the scenes. The parking lot reeked of weed; a few minutes later, a guy (the sandwich maker?) made his way into the restaurant, even though they had the doors locked…which also meant the restrooms weren’t available to use while we waited, and waited, and waited. The break was for no customers? The order was for four burgers and some drinks. The burger orders were all wrong, missing basics like ketchup, lettuce and tomato.A miserable experience, likely thanks to what appears to be tolerated pot breaks and failure at any quality control. Yea, we could have gone someplace else, but we’re picking up a Wendy’s specific item for an elderly relative. Avoid at all cost, as your time and money will just be as wasted the employees."
www.wendys.com,5,Very nice food and staff was helpful
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy's Location University & Central in Albuquerque, NM.My husband went inside to order a frosty but had nothing when he came out! He tells me the older white lady working was extremely rude to him & kept saying she knows him he's a trouble maker & didn't want to take his order. When we come to this location & if this older white lady is working she always gives us a hard time it's been really bad at times that I've left in tears. But on this day I went inside to order the frosty since she didn't serve my husband. I was the only customer in Wendy's & that older white lady just kept starring at me but never took my order! There were other employees there doing nothing & nobody even acknowledged me standing in front of the cash register much less take my order. All of this took place in front of the manager & he didn't do help me either.It's been almost 10 minutes of getting looked at like I was crazy & then I heard the older white lady talking to another employee about my husband & that employee telling her that I'm his wife. We'll I had enough & asked them what the problem was & if my order is gonna be taken we'll she had an evil laugh & ignored me while she got a cup & filled it up with a soda & was starring at me while she drank it! The manager was also standing there & instead of helping me he told me to get the f out of Wendy's!It's awful being treated badly when I hadn't done anything but stand there & wait quietly for someone to take my order!I left the store & as I'm walking out the older white lady & the employee she was talking to cussed me out calling me a b***h laughing at me!This upset me but it doesn't surprise me.Another mind-blowing visit was this time last year. I ordered food but I needed to use the bathroom.An employee opened the bathroom for me & was laughing I didn't understand why at 1st but once I was inside the bathroom I knew why he was laughing... That bathroom was disgusting!It looked as if someone got urine and threw it all over the walls, floor, sink, door, paper towel dispenser, toilet. It was shocking that the Wendy's employees would have any customers using that bathroom.What made things even worse is there are 2 bathrooms & for certain customers the employees would open the door to the clean bathroom & for the customers the employees didn't like they would open the door to the disgusting bathroom.When I brought it to they're attention I was so upset by everything I experienced I was in tears & the only thing I could say was they should be ashamed of themselves to treat people the way they do.If I would've stayed any longer I would've flipped out on all of the employees because while I was talking to them they all were laughing!The same manager was also there & didn't say or do anything about it.Every employee should be fired & replaced with kind, respectful individuals that take pride in they're job & how they treat others.Not only are these employees hateful & rude but they're dirty! I've witnessed most of them doing questionable things with they're hands & NOT wash they're hands & then prepare customers food!When I've brought it to they're attention & to the manager they all just ignore what I say to them & just tell me to leave the restaurant.My husband & I have been dealing with these horrible people for 5 years!I can't believe they all still have a job with Wendy's.They make Wendy's restaurant look bad & disgusting.The owners of this location need to do something about these people they hired & by something I mean fire all of them & ban them from getting hired at any another Wendy's for life!( This location is on University & Central in Albuquerque, New Mexico )"
www.wendys.com,1,"ordered the baconator fries, got quite literally nothing in the meal which is shocking as i paid £4.50 for it. Me and my boy have both bought them to be shocked by the portion size although we have had it before and not had this issue. Will definitely not be coming here again. Scam."
www.wendys.com,5,Very good service and I love there food it's wonderfull.there food has so much taste
www.wendys.com,1,"Go to Wendy's waited 7 mins at the Drive Thru even though there was no one else there at all. They charge a insane amount. Got charged almost $7.00 just for A cheeseburger. I could have gone to McDonald's, Burger King or even Taco Bell and got double or triple for that amount. They either need to hire new people so we all aren't sitting there forever and charge less or shut down. That is insane big time.."
www.wendys.com,1,Waited 30 minutes at drive thur.Order was wrong food was nasty drinks horrible and poor customer service. Never again
www.wendys.com,5,"Great food, great service, good priceAll around a good experience and will definitely be going back"
www.wendys.com,5,"This review is for CHYNA a very pleasant friendly young lady I went iñ expecting to pay $2.00 + for a small soft drink at the wendys pilot avondale location and this is where reviews are important because it shows that this employee paid attention to details in her jobs performance today she said to me all soft drinks are $1.00 and her attitude beautiful smile and customer service was a 10++ good job young lady, no no great job!"
www.wendys.com,1,The food was delivered cold. We were missing a drink from a meal. We ordered a French onion burger and got a bacon burger. The food was stodgy and lacked taste. Overall very disappointing- will never order that again Cambridge UK branch
www.wendys.com,2,"The food was cold and the fries were just bad. I spent over $12 and tossed most of it away. I sat in the drive through for almost 10 minutes alone, no one in front of me. This was at the Plymouth MN store. I knew I should have gone to the Taco Bell next door."
www.wendys.com,1,Shut the placedown awful food and filthy in there soggy over filled with ketchup in burger 😲 mcdonalds all the way and that's saying something
www.wendys.com,1,"I ordered a Dave's single and got a burger as small as Jr burger at dewey ave location in Rochester NY also my baked potato was as hard as my frozen butter when I called about my burger They told me to come back with the receipt and my burgerwhen I got there.They said that was a Dave, single the burger.No bigger than a junior burger that's highway robbery , that's a rip off"
www.wendys.com,1,I ordered the saucy nuggets at the Wendy’s on 4755 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy and it was soooo dry ! The nuggets were not saucy ! I could have bought reg nuggets and taken son condiments! Very disappointed and frustrated!
www.wendys.com,1,Visited the Hull Ganstead Lane branch and they missed off a portion of chicken nuggets. I waited ages for my order too. It was a take away order so didn’t realise until I got home.Probably due to the low I of the staff they employ- how difficult can it be to put items in a bag which you read from a list? Toddlers could do a better job.
www.wendys.com,1,I happen to know for a fact They hire Ex-Cons and should be avoided. I have seen the Wendys in Barrhaven hire Ex-convicts. I will only eat here is the employees are safe to be around. FIRE ALL YOUR CRIMINALS!
www.wendys.com,5,Called at Wendy's Barlbourgh..must say it was my first visit and will not be my last.Food was lovely and served by a lovely employee called Enry
www.wendys.com,4,"I visited Kingston-upon-Thames for a party on Saturday night. I'd parked my car at venue hall and spent the night in the travel lodge opposite.When I checked out of the hotel and went to get my car, I discovered it was locked in and the club wouldn't be open until 12pm so I had a few hours to kill. I wandered around Kingston looking for breakfast , and then at about 11:00 I saw Wendy's.A French onion burger and chilli beef loaded fries isn't your traditional breakfast I'll grant you, but I had a bit of a hangover and I hadn't had a Wendy's in years so wanted to try it, and so in we went.I placed my order on one of the machines and was nearly put off by the prices. My meal came to over £12 (burger, loaded fries, and what I thought was a milkshake) but I paid for it anyway and sat down to wait for it.About ten minutes later my number was called and I got my food. The loaded fries were probably the best I've ever had and the burger was lovely. The milkshake isn't really a milkshake and you have to eat it with a spoon and I wished I'd gotten a soft drink instead as you get to choose your driver and the flavour syrup at the drinks fountain and I'm a big fan of that.I'd ordered a double patty burger, and to be honest it was too much and I should have ordered a standard single one as I was stuffed by the end and left a bit.I've dropped a star because it seems pricey. I wouldn't be able to come here with the kids thats for sure but also for another reason.When we arrived there was a lady sitting eating on the table opposite coughing and spluttering without covering her mouth. It made me feel a bit sick and so I got up and moved to another part of the restaurant. Then just before my food arrived I saw her get up, dump her rubbish, and go back to work.... behind the counter of the restaurant.Luckily my food arrived just then so I know she had no part in cooking it, but it nearly put me off.It's probably a little unfair of me as people do get colds and at least she came in to work, but I can't help but think a food place should send people home (with full pay) when they're sick like that, in the name of hygiene, and that perhaps, if she'd coughed more politely (instead of sputtering into the air) then I might not have mentioned it. But there you go.Five star fast food, but docked a star for bad sick policy for staff."
www.wendys.com,1,We stopped at Wendy’s I spruce grove today for lunch. The burgers are thinner then they use to be and they have No favour at all. They were cold and the fries were not as good as they use too. Very disappointing and we will no longer go there for anything as the baconator is smaller patties are smaller
www.wendys.com,1,visit to cambridge branch. Food cold when asking for refund management were rude badly dressed looking like attending a night out. Had to argue for refund when eventualy did the manager refused to rufund the drink as i lost the cup which had not been used.
www.wendys.com,2,Had high hopes as have heard good things about this. The wait for two burgers and fries and two kids meals took forever. Enjoyed the fact they have jacket potatoes but the burgers were very average and I wouldn’t bother coming again.
www.wendys.com,5,"Wendy’s Kirkby - Very clean restaurant, the food was good. Menu selection great.Service was very fast, food was tasty!"
www.wendys.com,1,"First time at a Wendy's was my last time. Will deffo go back to Mc D. Went to Colchester stadium Wendy's, at home I found i no kids meal at all, though it had been paid for and my jacket potato had a green tinge to it. You get one star for the nice drink I had. Thanks  but no thanks ever again."
www.wendys.com,1,All the employees suck at there job there are slow and the don’t even ask me what kind of sauce or drink with my meal  so it makes it more confusing I clearly said to the girl a 6 peice nugget n I get home with No six piece nugget she ruined my whole meal I’m not eating anything from there anymore
www.wendys.com,1,Was disappointed that the pineapple frosty was really a vanilla frosty with pineapple syrup poured on top.Why not make a REAl pineapple frosty like when Wendy's offered the strawberry frosty?
www.wendys.com,1,"No cash .. all they have is screens . I want customer service,  cash tills I'm not able to use the screen things and I want to pay cash."
www.wendys.com,1,"The South location didn't return my card at the drive through. Mistakes happen and I should have realized it before I drove off, but when I drove back to get it, not one worker or the manager apologized for the inconvenience. Customer service and manners are a thing of the past. And my food was cold. ☹️"
www.wendys.com,5,It's really good
www.wendys.com,4,"Although it is fast food, somehow the menu seems more healthier than the other fast food chains.  What I don't like is sometimes the lack of customer service is jarring."
www.wendys.com,1,"The Wendy’s in Rock Hill S.C., at 2387 Cherry Rd. Used to be the greatest. The last few months it has fallen off bad. I always used the drive thru OTW to work. Today, at 5:30pm, I found out why this place has fell off a cliff. Went inside to pick up my online order and 6-7 Wendy employees were sitting in the dining area chatting and playing on their phones. My food was the typical ugh and now seeing why, I will not be returning to my once loved place."
www.wendys.com,1,"Awfully Awful staff extremely rude, food appalling, service in Southend even worse they lie refusing to give managers name.... quite honestly I wouldn't give the food to a starving dog let alone a human AVOID at all costs will be contacting head office to let them know to get competent staff to run the s..t show of a restaurant moving forward... proberly to keep the ""wendys"" franchise going personally I would close Southend ASAP"
www.wendys.com,5,"Good food, quick service and hot"
www.wendys.com,3,"The service was fine but.... I have always loved Wendy's chili. So I had a craving for  Wendy's chili today. Went to Wendy's on Jefferson in Cookeville,TN today. Was the worst chili I've ever gotten at Wendy's. I've purchased chili at this store before and it was great but today. Nope. It appeared as if they cut their hamburger patties in half. Threw them in the bottom of the bowl and spooned the rest on top. Had way to much meat and didn't taste good at all. Needless to say I'll never buy Wendy's chili again."
www.wendys.com,1,"Went to the Wendy’s located at 24 w 23rd at in Manhattan again today, waited 20 mins for a salad and nuggets. My salad was just sitting there while they kept serving other customers! Then I get to work and notice they forgot my toppings for my salad. Every time I go there the wait is long and takes up half my meal time and they forget stuff, even tho it’s up on a screen! Gonna stop going there completely."
www.wendys.com,1,"I bought a £9 large meal yesterday, the drink was disgusting and I thought that's alright as I got my own water bottle, then when i opened my meal pack, the fries suppose to be a larger one. Yes, it is in a large fries box but the amount of that it's same with medium one. i compare with my friend's and i decided to ask the lady that work in wendys, and she gave an answer that"" it is normal, it just a large box, but it is the amount of that..""  Real bad experience, won't step into Wendy again."
www.wendys.com,1,"We placed our order at the Whitby branch, and then realised the lift was out of order.  We had to carry a push chair and a baby, and the meal, up the tiny staircase.  We also noticed the toilet was out of order. I suspect it's always out of order to put off undesirables?  Perhaps use a code on the receipt like other restaurants?  The service was so slow and painful,  I think there were just 2 people working.  Also to add to the list of failures,  the coffee machine wasn't working?   Really?  I can't imagine all these things were out of action at the same time.  Perhaps I would suggest the restaurant shouldn't be open without toilet facilities and a working lift?  This branch is not doing you any favours.   We weren't the only ones getting annoyed at the snail service.   And I'm found since this day that your customer service is unobtainable, and when i did finally get thru to someone,  they just didn't care.  My first and last visit"
www.wendys.com,1,"breakfast wrap,,plastic melted cheese,,sausage was just loaded with pepper once that hit my mouth I could tase nothing else. not real eggs ,,just one piece of a potato that was just mush..I can't believe there is any team that does a taste test and puts this on the market, put the bag right in the garbage...zero stars...... maybe if the stores made it as you see on tv it might be better...."
www.wendys.com,5,"Made my first visit to Wendy's in Croydon this afternoon. It was a great experience. The restaurant wasn't busy and so the service was friendly and quick. I had a Cheeseburger, medium fries and coke. The burger was perfect: juicy, tasty with just the right amount of fresh tomato, lettuce, mayo and pickle on it. The bun was the best burger bun I have had in a long time. This Wendy's burger was SO much better that McDonald's. When I'm next in Croydon, it will be Wendy's that I plan to visit."
www.wendys.com,1,"Hoping U check your camera to see the boys sat together and one stood up walked all way around seating area to punch someone in the nose. The pain remains even 10 hour later because he did so more than once, y'all need to check that CCTV for 3.47pm on sept 09. He watched closely n then went at it had it be that the person who experienced this retaliate there be uproar. First step check for the instigator then then you know where things started."
www.wendys.com,1,"Rubbish customer communications. UK Wendy's don't offer any form of military/bluelight discounting, which I find odd, as Wendy's USA can't do enough.Don't waste your time sending any form of email to their H Q. as it will be deleted.Shame. Next time I'm in S.C. it'll be Chick-Filet or Jack in the box for me."
www.wendys.com,1,"The Southpark Wendy’s on Carnegie Blvd. needs to go the way of dinosaurs and just become extinct. Slow service, overcooked food, rude staff. Dave Thomas would roll over in his grave if he knew how his legacy is now a behind-the-times fallacy."
www.wendys.com,4,I’m very disappointed at the service at Wendy’s fist of all how do they have a bathroom for customers how do they have a sign up talking the bathroom is not for the public I’m not the public I was a customer I purchased food this has to be addressed as soon as possible
www.wendys.com,1,July 29th I ordered Taco Salad to eat on site. once I had paid and received my food they told me they had no forks meaning I had no way to eat my salad. They also had no taco chips which was part of the meal. I asked for a manager and they refused. I asked for a refund and that was refused. I left with no food and no refund. I called corporate customer service three times since then and keep being told that a regional manager would call me but that has never happened. Just awful experience. I love their food but will not return to that location.
www.wendys.com,1,"Went to Wendy’s Southend on Sea by accident (meant to go into MacDonalds next door, but stayed as I had lovely memories of how good Wendys use to be. Much of the menu was sold out (4pm) but chose a chicken wrap. I had to wait 25 minutes for it and it consisted or one piece of chicken with a small leaf of lettuce on a half frozen pita. I was a massive disappointment to say the least. But when eating my wrap, I looked around at the cheap furniture, the piles of rubbish, the place was simply disgusting. How did Wendys go from posh fast food to this. MacDonalds, which I have a pretty low regard for would have been quicker, cleaner, more and cheaper."
www.wendys.com,3,Called in today for breakfast which was very tasty but what spoilt my visit was the state of the toilets they where disgusting I don't think anyone as cleaned the toilet bowl in a long time with stains under the lid
www.wendys.com,1,"Wendy’s at whitby ! Horrendous no one tells you the set up and when you work it out , the meal I bought for the family was £31 everything was freezing cold , portions were tiny , you order yourself, pour drinks yourself, take it to the table yourself and get charged a fortune! But the worst thing is how cold it was ! Never go back ever !Go to Wetherspoons same price and a thousand times better. This used to be papas fish and chip’s restaurant but I know for a fact that Wendy’s will be closed next year with this attitude ."

locations.in-n-out.com,1,"I've been deceived for many years by In N Out Burger ! Led to believe they use healthy beef raised at their own facility.... Without 'additives' as they say.The truth is, In N Out has been deceiving the public.Their beef comes from HARRIS RANCH, where the cows are treated with cancer causing chemicals in the form of antibiotics, hormones & steroids.These cows are treated with abuse on a minutely basis , and living in their own excrement/ feces, because they are crammed into cages. They are called Frankencows and this facility is nicknamed Cowsowitz.The fries are cooked with Cottonseed Oil, which is toxic & not approved for human consumption.The buns are GMO containing the cancer causing chemicals Glyphosate .The Vanilla Shake contains Vanillin,a chemical preservative & the signature sauce is chemicals corn syrup causing diabetes ,etc.In N Out is the ONLY fast food joint that failed to divulge it's food sources & ingredients, using phrases like All Natural Beef & Fresh Ingredients.My health can't afford to eat at this place ever again.

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Wow-I went to the chick-fil-a in Greendale Wisconsin with my 10 year old son. The food was great. The atmosphere in food area is a loud and it’s an extension of a casino they had 2 sets of craps (playing dice) going on. A supervisor name Corrie was doing an interview with an applicant. The interview ended at 4:15pm and he looked at one table shooting dice and he just walked directly by them. These kids have made this into a hangout slash casino. I will not be returning someone should police this foolery before it gets more out of control. I informed Malik who notified manager. Malik asked me what supervisor saw this. I informed him Corrie. I then observed Malik go tell a black male this information. The black male just continued to pack orders. Review the CCTV footage for confirmation. I have never witnessed anything like this in my life.
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I hardly ever eat fast food. I chose chick fil-a.  Now wish I hadn't.  The food was not good. The fries tasted old stale yuck, the salad had wilted pieces of lettuce that ruined the whole salad.  I was not given a salad fork. Should I eat with hands? Such a lousy experience.  Chicken fil a has seriously gone down hill...yikes...won't be going to get wilted salad and horrible old fries ever again... couldn't even finish either ...oh and yea had to get a fork elsewhere"
www.chick-fil-a.com,3,"Ordered 2 combos tonight 9/15/25, seems like there is a major disconnect with quality control, how do you get cold fries in a busy drive thru,and the ice dream is a joke it's a kiddie cup off the kids menu, fast food is expensive, a little attention to detail would be great, other than the it's my pleasure tag line"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Chick fil a has a stupid rule with a limit to how many receipts you can upload manually within 30 days. What difference does it make how many you upload manually if you are spending money giving them your business? I see this as unappreciative
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I have heard some times ago that chick Gil-a has a better quality than other fast food. But when I tried it last week it was awful. The sandwiches we ordered was a dry chicken a piece of rotten lettuce and the buns were old and stale. What do they think , because they had a lot of customers, they can feed people what ever junk they want to . But customer are smart. It might take some times but eventually they’ll lose their customer.As it is they have hardly 2 stars reviews."
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,Had a Pretzel Cheddar Club while traveling at an Augusta GA Chick Fil-a and it wasn't tasty at all. I found nothing enjoyable about it. Enough said!

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I’ve been a regular customer at Chick-fil-A, but my last visit to the Pueblo, CO location was unacceptable. I ordered a salad and found a long hair in it on the very first bite. When I called, I was told the only option was to return immediately for a refund, even though the restaurant was close to closing. When I asked for a manager, I was hung up on. After driving back and wasting more of my time, all I was given was a simple refund — no apology, no accountability, and no concern for food safety.This experience shows a complete lack of customer care and hygiene standards. Pueblo deserves better from a brand that claims to put service first."

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"2730 Manchester Expressway in Columbus Georgia, on 7/25/2025 @ 7:30 after work on the way home I stop by this location, where I go morning for breakfast, and almost every day for lunch. Because I work at the hospital down from them. I wanted to buy my daughter, 5 year old granddaughter, and myself dinner after I got off. My granddaughter has autism disability. I explained this to the manager of the store, my granddaughter will not eat the fried with the salt on them. I already knew they will not just drop fries if you ask for fried with no salt. So I didn't ask them to do that. I ask the young lady who was the manager of the store could I just wait until they drop another batch and before they put it in the salt can they then give me my granddaughter with no salt. This manager said no. They still wouldn't do it, for her, even if I wait till they drop more fries.This made no sense at all to me. So you have to drop fries back there anyway, I didn't mind waiting until you do on your time, for my granddaughter. You can't just get the fries out with no salt for her before you dump them in salt. She said no. What a heartless person, she lied also and said corporate wouldn't let them do it. I call corporate customer service, while I was still there at the store. The lady in customer service said that's not true, she could have done it. I will not go to this location again. The lady I talk to said they are going to have someone else to get back with me in the corporate office."
www.chick-fil-a.com,3,"A serious decline in food quality!  We have been visiting Chik Fil-A for decades and very rarely would there be a problem. But, more recently, the food quality has declined. This morning we purchased two Chicken Biscuit breakfasts and the Chicken Biscuit I received was pitiful! The chicken filet was so thin, it looked like it had been intentionally pounded flat (as for scallopine) and perhaps pulled from another breast piece. I wish I'd photographed it and had a ruler with me, because I don't want to exaggerate, but the thickness of the filet looked to be somewhere between 1/4"" to only 1/3"" thick! To be able to taste it, I pulled it from the biscuit to eat it. The biscuit had some kind of 'off' flavor, too.  The only reason for a 3-star rating today is because of the delightful and helpful staff. I don't doubt that they would have replaced the sandwich had I asked, but I didn't want to have to wait to be served again. This complaint is really directed toward whomever is managing their kitchen at that location; a paltry filet of that measly size and thickness should never have made it onto the grill for a sandwich in the first place! Somebody should be watching closely to ensure that their ingredients are top-notch BEFORE being served to a customer!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"The Chik-Fil-A on 480 E Stroop Rd Dayton Ohio is an abomination. They have been serving their chicken sandwich to me for two years straight with completely rotten lettuce. Rotten as in BLACK. They do it 99% of the time, I guess it is their policy.Furthermore, I went there and they handed me something VILE and disgusting. Then the lady wouldn't take it back because its their policy that you have to keep it in your car once they hand anything to you. What about my policy that you don't hand me something nasty and then refuse to take it back.Chik-Fil-A used to be the best in customer service, now they are literally rock bottom, worst in class. By the way, the nasty NOT food you handed me is on the ground in your parking lot. Enjoy."
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"I’m writing to express my disappointment with the experience I had at the 1185 Woodstock Rd, Roswell, GA 30075 chick fil a restaurant on July 12th, around 4:45 PM.As a longtime customer who has always appreciated the food and service, I was surprised and frustrated by what occurred. The restaurant was nearly empty, and I was standing by the mobile order/catering pickup area while six employees stood nearby, seemingly unoccupied. Despite making eye contact and waiting patiently for several minutes, no one acknowledged me.After about three minutes, I was left with no choice but to raise my voice and ask, “Can someone come over here and help me?”—which I regret having to do, as it’s not how I like to communicate. The lack of attention and basic courtesy was both disappointing and out of character for your team, based on all my previous visits.I hope this feedback helps reinforce the importance of attentiveness and professionalism, even during slower hours. I look forward to returning soon and seeing the level of service I’ve always come to expect."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,First your chicken sandwiches are so salty now they are inedible. And if someone were to order a strawberry milkshake they might expect to have strawberry flavoring whether it be real strawberry or some sort of artificial strawberry. What I received was a cup  of sickly sweet white glop with what I'm guessing was an extremely unpleasant artificial vanilla flavor.To many other fast food places to waste my time with Chick-fil-a
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,Chick Fil A on Jog and Lantana in Lake Worth Florida should not be charging 10$ for 4 chicken tender entree alone on doordash. That is way too OP even for rich people. And ya'll doin this by the hood. Keeping the poor people poor. Shame!
www.chick-fil-a.com,3,The atmosphere was friendly and busy in St. Louis Missouri.    I was given a gift card so treated my mom and I to lunch.  She was satisfied with her chicken sandwich but mine was so so.  It tasted okay but the bun fell completely apart.  Trying to eat it was rather difficult and extremely messy.  Considering the price I expected better quality.  Not sure if I will return.
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,"Chick Fil A is the best! I LOVE their chicken nuggets, and my daughter loved her Mac and cheese. So sad there aren’t a lot of locations near us! We love coming here every week after my daughters cheer class. The employees are so nice and friendly. When my sprite didn’t taste right they were so helpful and happy to help me."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I was let down by the customer service at the Chick-fil-A location in Mira Mesa, San Diego, CA 92126. On several occasions, my orders were incorrect. I reached out to the manager, Taylor, who acknowledged the oversight and offered me a reward of 12 chicken nuggets. When I returned days later to redeem my reward, I ordered a large fries, a spicy chicken sandwich, and a large strawberry lemonade. However, when I got to the window, the young man scanned my reward but charged me $26. I knew this was incorrect, as the total should have been around $16. When I pointed this out, he began to argue with me. I refused to engage in a dispute, and Taylor came over to assist. She asked me to come inside for clarification. Once inside, she handed me the 12 chicken nuggets. It seems Taylor needs to improve her leadership skills; instead of apologizing for her employees' mistakes and the overcharge, she displayed an attitude. This was an unfortunate experience at Chick-fil-A, unlike any I have encountered elsewhere. I hope both the owner and customers take note of the issues at this location."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Went to their establishment in Roblox. Absolutely DESPICABLE service. First the junior accused me of eating the food when I did not receive it. When I asked for a manager she left. When the new junior came in I asked for 10 water bottles and she said she can't do that and left. I am now alone and thirsty in the Chick Fil-a.
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"What happened to chik filet, they really are terrible now!! They used to be fast on orders, they used to have a great website, wonderful customer service, etc, its all bad now! I got a free sandwich but you have to work for NASA in order to claim the free thing! I clciked on everything on their site and nothing worked, which makes me wondwer why they even send it out! Then i decided just pay full price and its almost impossible to screw up their sandwiches, pickles or no picklers, butter on bread or not. i ordered no butter and i got extra butter! Lastly fill out the survey telling them the screw up and do they offer to give you a new item, no, they just say we will tell the person responsible...wow..really down hill now...."
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,"I worked at Chick-fil-a for four years in high school. Great first job, not super high-paying but consistent, and the food is far higher quality than what you might get at, say, McDonald's or Wendy's. Three years after high school, halfway through my junior year in college, I went back to the same Chick-fil-a, and they let me work there a couple weeks. Even with just above minimum wage pay, it was more than worth it for the free meal I got with every shift. That was 15 years ago, and I still love the food.In fast food, these three remain: In-N-Out burger, Chipotle, and Chick-fil-a. But the greatest of these is Chick-fil-a."
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"Used to like this joint. Prices seem like they are going up every day, food quality lacks at some locations. I'd rather get a quick bite elsewhere."
www.chick-fil-a.com,3,"Very expensive and not a lot of food.  Very mid range taste, far better choices elsewhere.  They do chicken burgers, spicy chicken burgers, nuggets, waffle fries and drinks in their Lisburn branch, that's it. I don't know about elsewhere but after all the hype, tailbacks on the motorway etc, I was severely disappointed with what I got."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I have long admired the business model and advertised values of this company. I love that they try to hire polite, respectful and respectable kids and teach them to treat customers appropriately. I want to support a business with their objectives. While I don’t find their food as fantastic as all the raves, to me it is good but extra salty, the spicy is too spicy and it is expensive, but it is a nice alternative and their salads are good.However, I am finished with them and here’s why.1. Their lines are difficult to maneuver and stretch into a major road blocking it both ways.2. You cannot see the menu until too late but there is a long line of cars so you feel pressure to expedite the process. But there are questions or changes and errors. (Not everyone, always wants to order ahead online.) I’ve never had any confusion or errors when ordering fast food burgers, sandwiches or tacos etc. elsewhere.3. Quite some time ago I was placing a family order. After I stated all the items I needed, the young man made a suggestion for an alternative that was available in response to a question I had asked earlier and then he rearranged items into “meal deals”. That was fine and should have actually slightly reduced my cost, however it got messed up and I was charged twice for the things I originally ordered individually but were then placed into “meal deals” meaning I paid for the “deals” AND the same items separately even though I was not adding items, he was simply moving items in my list. Also I was charged for an item that was first ordered but then changed to something else. It wasn’t that they put these extra items in my order, they merely CHARGED me for the items twice and the deleted item.FYI It does no good to call a local franchise owner. He either doesn’t care! or has no authority???I called headquarters and was told I’d be sent gift cards to make up for the mess up.4. Fast forward a long time.We do not order fast food as often as maybe many do, but we have been back a bunch of times. Most times my husband picks up, sometimes I do. I changed out of my big purse and haven’t been carrying as many cards or “stuff” so I’ve ended up paying each time and hadn’t used my gift cards. Tonight I tried!! I remembered to take them with me.Oops! They aren’t for an amount of $. They are only good for certain items. So I have to quick decide which card can I use for what. Only this one will work. NO! They are expired!!!!  And the poor kid with only authority to touch buttons on an iPad couldn’t care less.A gift or card that expires is nothing!!! All companies know that a huge percentage of gift cards are never redeemed. That’s why they love to use and sell them. Customer loses!Bottom line…..I won’t be back!There are dozens of restaurants within a block."

(We are from Tennessee) The ease of putting the order in ahead of time and the quick and organized way it was served was amazing.

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"There was no one at the drive thru to take our order (double line), so we waited to place an order at the window - 15 minutes later and only 3 cars in front of us.  When we did get to the window, the employee wanted to argue with us, saying 'yes there is someone taking orders outside'.  So we placed are order and waited another 15 minutes to get our food, which was wrong.  We sent an email to customer service and the only response was, give us another try, and have a sandwich on us.  Throwing money or food at someone to make the problem go away doesn't improve things for the next customer!!!"

www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"Was treated extremely poorly by management staff over the phone right after I placed my order and also corporate the same day. Do not understand why management feels now that they can just beat the people any kind of way especially when they’re spending a lot of money for lunch. Another sign that is time to stop giving, my harder money to fast food restaurants and maybe just start doing stuff for my own. With all pissed off customers it seems on here now the more people stop eating at fast food restaurants, and affecting their profits the more they’ll see that it is us who keep them in business and will not tolerate disrespect. I have made up my mind no more fast food restaurants."

www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"Chick Fil A is a restaurant that continues to pride itself in it's customer service and excellent food variety. Unfortunately due to inflation, the food prices have gone up and the portion sizes have DECREASED! This means you need to order more food/chicken sandwiches, just to get a meals worth.  It's bad enough that Chick Fil A is still anti LGBTQ  (Yet they still want their money) but but now they want to serve BURGERS? I have no idea what Chick Fil A even is or stands for anymore. Saying that I have been disappointed in them for over the past two years, is an understatement."

www.chick-fil-a.com,5,What made my experience was the great food and the great customer service
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,"Chick-fil-A is the best fast food restaurant I have ever been to. They truly put the ""FAST"" in fast food. Even if the drive-thru line wraps around the building, they get me in and out in less than ten minutes. My food always arrives hot, no matter what I order. Their menu offers something for any mood, from salads and nuggets to sandwiches—all of which are delicious. Not only do they have excellent lunch and dinner options, but they also serve breakfast. I could eat their chicken minis every morning; they are the perfect way to start the day. I love going with my friends or family because it is affordable and offers something for everyone. Their waffle fries are, without a doubt, the best fast food fries I have ever tasted, melting in my mouth every time. Also, I have never had a bad experience with an employee. They are always nice, polite, and helpful, and they never get my order wrong. It is also a nice change to have a person take your order instead of a kiosk. Also, Chick-fil-A never seems to be out of anything, unlike other fast food restaurants. Their food is always fresh and not processed. While it may not be the healthiest option, it is a lot better than most other fast food places. Regardless of which location I visit, I always have the same positive experience. Going to Chick-fil-A always makes my day better. I highly recommend you try it some time!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Chick-fil-A I am shaking my head at you. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!! I'm upset that I wasted $15 on your grilled chicken nuggets today because what a joke. I mean when I see that someone's offering grilled chicken versus the you know battered chicken fried chicken whatever I think okay great they're actually trying to offer a healthier option I got very excited because I like to order grilled chicken and I often feed it to my dog so when I'm traveling around town doing errands and they're riding in the car with me I usually go to El Pollo loco but because I was near Chick-fil-A and I enjoy a good Chick-fil-A nugget with some Chick-fil-A sauce however it is not the same for these grilled nuggets which makes me wonder now about the rest of your products???? These dang nuggets were so unbelievably greasy, they appear to have some type of fake grill mark on them or maybe the smell was a fake like smoke smell or something that you know is t realistic with them being made in a kitchen .  The grill marks I  was able to run off and I tried to soak up the gross grease best I could but I just always thought so highly of your establishment until today.  I feel bad for even feeding these to my dogs.  And will stick with the other place in the future unless you all shape up.  But giving my hard earn money for crap really doesn't sit well with me anymore.   Shame on you allAngela Smedley"

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"In a recent breakfast visit, I was deciding on the 4 count Mini entree and whether to buy multiples for my granddaughter in order for it to be filling. The server suggested the 10 count, which was not on the menu. I proceeded to order the 10 count, not bothering to ask the price because I thought the price would reflect a reasonable amount since I was buying, kind of, in bulk. When I left the store and checked my receipt, I was surprised to see that for the 10 count min entree, I was charged $14.25. At $4.55 per 4 count entree, I could have ordered 3 entrees, received 2 more minis, and it would have only cost $13.65. What deceptive practice for a company who used to pride itself on being upstanding and beyond reproach in the business world.I only post my complaint here because I have read about so many complaints that go unanswered from cooperate ChickFilA that I wanted to try and make people aware on different platforms. The moral of the lesson is…always ask for the price before ordering something not displayed on the menu."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I worked late and decided to grab Chick-fil-A  instead of cooking. This particular Chick-fil-A, located in Dobbin Center (#01454) is operated by Joe Dinoto and was being managed (during the time of my visit) by Shift Manager David A. Now that I gave you the landmark, I will dive into my complaint.An employee by the name of Faith, rudely and obnoxiously, took my order and acted as if I pulled up to her window, at her house, instead of a speaker at a major food chain. First and foremost, she took her time to ask what I wanted and kept responding,""mmmhmm"" everytime I spoke. Since when is that part of the script at Chick-fil-A? I initially thought that I was mistaken, so I turned my music off, and sure enough, she was still responding, ""mmmhmm"" so I asked her if I was missing something and if she was okay, because I didn't know her personally, so she had no reason to be acting as if we had beef.After the drama with trying to place my order, I pulled to the window and demanded to know the name of the person that took my order. Nobody would give me her name, so I asked to speak to the manager and that's when David A. came to the window and told me that her name was Faith, followed by repeatedly apologizing for her unprofessionalism and said that he would talk to her. I said thank you, paid for my food and pulled off.  Something told me to check my receipt and sure enough, Faith was so busy being obnoxiously unprofessional that she just rang up anything. She only got a portion of my order correct, so I ended up having to go inside the store. David A. was at the register so I approached him and explained to him that I was given the wrong order. David A. apologized again and said that he would make it right. He told me to keep what I was given and gave me the difference in the cost and a new order.I remember a time when Chick-fil-A was known for their top notch customer service. Now they just employ any ole body, the prime example being Faith.  She carried herself as if she was the franchise owner and I was visiting her establishment, therefore (in her mind) it was acceptable to talk to people any kind of way, but it's not. Consumers controll everything. If people stopped patronizing that location, it would have no choice but to reduce staff and/or close. I think that Faith should be written up and taken off of the front line for the sake of that particular location. She is a poor representative for the company and bad for business. At this point, I am done with that location. David A. was great and should be the standard for how to represent a company, but Faith on the other hand, is the reason why I am taking my business elsewhere."

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"The chik filet ap is terrible. I purchased an order for $17 for someone a week ago. When I went back online today and clicked on 2 items only it repeated last order and charged me. So it was a complete waste of money. I've been using fast food aps for years, never seen one this bad!"

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"My family will NEVER eat at Chick-fil-A ever again. They call themselves a Christian organization, but when it requires a sacrifice, they fail miserably. My uncle (87 years old) was walking out of the Harker Heights, TX restaurant and fell because of two things: 1) the mat was not secured, and 2) the SMALL area to exit the restaurant ALSO had a table. My uncle was exiting and trying to get through that small room and the doors were so strong and the mat was not secured so my uncle FELL and hit his head on a TABLE that was in that tiny room! He is on blood thinners, so he was rushed to the ER.Incredibly (but not surprisingly) Chick-fil-A’s insurance company, Sedgwick, claimed that the restaurant has no duty to pay for anything since “through their investigation, they were not negligent.” Well, how convenient! YOUR insurance company found no negligence? Well that must be great to know that YOUR insurance company will never find any negligence on YOUR part!You should have seen how hard they were scrambling in the restaurant after it happened. They looked like scared animals trying to figure how to deal with an elderly man that FELL because of their MAT and the TINY area and the TABLE that has no business in that tiny room.Their insurance adjust said, ""Well we've never had any falls at that restaurant."" We replied, ""How many falls have you had at other restaurants?"" She said she was unable to say. Ummm YEAH because you don't WANT TO ADMIT that you've had falls at other restaurants! NO PLACE FOR THE ELDERLY, DISABLED, OR WHEELCHAIR-BOUND PEOPLE AT CHICK-FIL-A!!!!!!!NEVER AGAIN WILL MY FAMILY EAT AT Chick-fil-A! My uncle is a Christian and is appalled at this level of deceit and villainous lack of responsibility. NEVER, EVER, EVER AGAIN!"

The door was unlocked and both the store front window and your website state this location opens at 6:30 am. I purchased my coffee at McDonald's,who were more than happy to provide service. I have no intention of using your restaurants ever again. My first and last time.Left two online complaints and a phone call to chick fil a without a response or apology. Chick fil a also ignored my better business bureau complaint."

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Chic Fil-a is highly overrated. The restaurant packs customers orders in very small containers. Chic Fil-a in South Bend, Indiana does not know how to cook ""Chicken Tor Soup"", it has chic peas and gravy. Soup are cook in broths not gravy. And the restaurant does not have or offer enough side items. The food is not worth a visit, go somewhere else to eat."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Was visiting your east Main Street, Spartanburg, sc, location. Ordered my food and asked for my military discount being a retired desert storm veteran. I was told by the cashier that they only honor currently serving soldiers who have to be in uniform to get it and not any of us retired veterans who’ve already served. She said that was policy. I was beyond livid!!! It’s like myself and the other millions of veterans who’ve sacrificed and served don’t matter to chick fil a. I’ll add this location to the one in Duncan, sc, that I’ll never visit it again. The one in Duncan, sc, doesn’t honor veterans either."

Still tastes the same but very few fries.  It's not like Chick Fil A is hard up for money they have to slice the chicken in half They need to go back to the way it used to be"
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,Absolutely love the chicken burger and waffle fries. Chic fil A sauce is very good. I'd love to eat here every day if I could. But I do wish they added more veggies and condiments to the burger as opposed to just bun and a patty with pickles.

Because I placed an order through Uber eats and chick fil a did provide a quality check to ensure the delivery person was given the correct order they are not responsible for their error.

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,DO NOT PURCHASE a giftcard. This company makes you jump through hoops to find the balance by requesting you join their site that “needs” info it does NOT need! If you join this site then you must “transfer” the giftcard info to site making the actual card null and void. WHAT? WHY? If you don’t join site you MUST go into a physical location to get balance. I bet once at their restaurant the cashier will NOT be able to tell you this info ( have been through this scenario before so am skeptical). So DO NOT PURCHASE their giftcards. Your recipient will thank you.

But don't let that fool you . He helps all the schools in our local community each week by having a give back night.So what he makes in profits , some of that money is given back to the school he is hosting that week. He and his daughter show up at local events as well , on Saturdays you can see them at a local fundraiser for a historic home close to his restaurant.

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I visited a Chick Fil-a here in Bmore, located on the National Pike. I ordered a kids chicken strip, macaroni & cheese, and a Sprite…of course some dipping sauce. After going through the drive thru, I parked to go in to use the restroom. I noticed I didn’t get the sauce, so I got some. Back to my car, no napkins or a fork for my Mac & cheese. I went in to get those! Back to my car, no strips but chicken nuggets! I had to go in 3 times! The manager didn’t want to talk to me. I demanded and all she offered, besides the strips, was a COOKIE. No “I apologize”, or here’s your money back, etc. It was exhausting! I gave it to a family member to eat after this debacle I wasn’t hungry anymore!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I went to Chick-Fil-A, on a Saturday night, and when I got home, I discovered someone took a bite out of my sandwich!  I won't be buying from them, anymore.I thought it might be interesting to discover what's in their chicken sandwich.  I found out it contains MSG, an excitotoxin.Excitotoxins, like aspartame and MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) overstimulate neurons in the brain.  When these neurons are overstimulated they quickly become exhausted and die.  In short, excitotoxins can alter the chemistry of the brain."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"My wife and I stop by your Northridge CA. store on Tampa St,  Monday thru Friday every morning on the way to work for 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 drinks. Just about every morning we get the same rude employee going through the drive thru. She asked what do we want. We are polite people. Never ask if we want sauces We say thank you never says ""my Pleasure"" like all the other employees. We get to the window even if no one else is there it takes your employee 8-10 minutes to complete the order. She's always socializing with another employee, we can hear the conversation. She manhandles the sandwiches when putting them in the bag and never puts napkins in, everytime. She also takes our credit card inside the window instead of just sticking the machine out. We really believe management needs to train her a little more. I don't know her name I just can describe her an an African American heavy set woman with bright red hair. We would love to stay good customers but not the way we've been treated."

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"The store in York,Pa. Refused to give a Military Discount yet gives them only to cops. Hmmm ? WONDER WHY?"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,I ordered a delivery order from Chick-Fila Braselton. I understand that they charge a surcharge on delivery pricing (to go or in restaurant prices are cheaper). I also know they charge a delivery fee. All of which I am good with. What I have an issue with is I placed an 11.00 order for them to literally take across the street and they charged an additional 1.50 after I checked out. I emailed them and got a blow off corporate response from some corporate PR guy who is extremely bad at his job. He didn’t not even read my complaint. It was just a boiler plate response about how they charge delivery fees to cover costs. No shoot Sherlock! Cedric Needs to be terminated for being incompetent.

Called store was told by cashier & the Manager Channing Smith that their “new policy” was to make customers drive back to their store to show their receipt because they’ve had so many complaints of missing items. This was after I had already told both of them I went thru the drive thru as we don’t live there and we’re on our way to an event & they confirmed they found my receipt in their records. When I asked why would I have to drive back to them to bring in my receipt after they already confirmed they have it electronically and how would that “prove I wasn’t lying” (as was implied by Channing numerous times)  I  was simply told to call corporate. The email response from Corporate was that they referred my concern back to the store. The store emailed me a coupon for a brownie & shake. When I responded that I need a refund as there is no chick fil a in my area the store again reiterated their “new policy” of not refunding for missing and rancid items.After numerous communications and giving them numerous opportunities to make this right only to be refused they left me no other options but to post a review in hopes that someone in the organization will see and step up to do the right thing. And yes, I did dispute the charge on my card so now they can spend more money in salaries responding and handling that as well as paying the charge back fee they’ll automatically incur. They should  have just done the right thing in the beginning."

We called the restaurant and talked to a Jen who was very friendly and told us those items would be placed in our second order. When we received our second order, those missing items were not in the bag. We called the restaurant again to inform them of this and spoke to a Trish who was very rude and short with us and just kept throwing around that she is the manager, and it was grubhubs fault not Chic-fil-a's. This happened to us last week as well and were giving our order with a missing sandwich. I beleive that staff needs to doubt check that the order is correct before giving it to the grubhhub driver."

When I went to the Chick-fil-A website to order, it directed me to another site (DoorDash) to place the order.  Neither were willing to send the missing items.  Chick-fil-A blamed DoorDash and said there was nothing they could do since it involved a 3rd party.  Clearly, they have a collaborate business arrangement or I would not have been directed to their site. DoorDash provided an insufficient ""credit"" that did not cover the taxes, fees, and tip they expected AGAIN for a meal that didn't arrive and was already paid for.  Sorely disappointed in lack of service from both organizations."

They were out of breakfast items And if I wanted something else it would be an extra charge. I said you took my money you burnt a gallon of by gas and time in line and now you tell me this. I was mad and irritated at the attitude and sarcastic apology.I told them this was not a Christian way to act and I let them know I was pissed. Another lady came to the window and called me an a—holeI drove off. No food. The charge is still in my AMX.

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Visted there on 5/21/2022. Between my daughter and I we spent over $70.00. The receipt stated that if I filled out a survey, I would receive a free sandwich. I normally spend about $100 per month at this location. Within a few hours of eating, I completed the online survey, and it was submitted.In the last two weeks I have called three times to their corporate customer service being told each time they were going to escalate my complaint, So far nothing.I called the store yesterday and left my phone number and explained my situation. Again zippo.I guess they are not concerned about losing my twice weekly visits nor the $100 per month I spend there. My rathr larger family will also avoid this restaurant.Sad."

www.chick-fil-a.com,2,OK so when I ordered my kids meal for my child I ordered a chocolate milk and when I came home and we were unwrapping our stuff and they forgot to put it in there. It was too late to go back for just a chocolate milk. I would make sure to look at what you ordered before you leave.
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,i got explosive diarrhea from their food for the past 3 days. The sandwich and sauce wasn’t even that good 0/10
www.chick-fil-a.com,4,"Just had my first chicken sandwich from this place and it's one of best ones I've ever had from a fast food joint.  Came out quick and hot from the drive thru.  Definitely up there with popeye's, if not better."
www.chick-fil-a.com,4,"I love how fast the lines are and how hot the food is when it's served to you and how you can skip the line by ordering on the app! Thank you for good, cheap, delicious meals!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"When it comes to how they pay their employees, they really aren't any better than Wendy's McDonald's are any other place that pays bi-weekly. Last time I checked Whataburger is still the top fast food restaurant are at least one of a very few. You see unlike Chick FIL A ""Whataburger"" and those few others who do pay weekly understand bills are do weekly not every other week. So until they start treating their employees like people and not a business I can't in good faith give them 5 ⭐. No matter how great the service truly is because I know that just because it's not being said there are employees struggling because of the bi weekly pay. And no I'm not an employee just someone who has struggled with being paid bi weekly."
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"Do not try their salads. I gave them a try twice, the first time it was completely wrong I got a Cobb salad and it had black beans. I got a coupon for a free salad due to the issue, that salad was even worst the lettuce was soggy and everything was room temperature like it had been left out and not refrigerated."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"We ordered our food from Cuyahoga Falls Howe Rd Chic Fil A.  We had never ordered through Ubereats before so being unsure I called and the young man was kind enough to double check my order but also informed me he got in trouble. Food was delivered and an item was not delivered, so no problem I simply called the restaurant and Tim the manager began cursing and told me to call Ubereats and hung up on me. Be careful of Tim and his cursing mouth on Howe Rd. Not very Christian."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Chick Filet is is a very disrespectful and dishonest place. They hid behind the owners name whom they say is Christian based but the individuals inside working aren’t christian at all.  They are rude and don’t deserve great workers. Please don’t be fooled by these jokers and hypocrites. DO NOT EAT THERE! They are NIT to be trusted!!!!
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Hello. Please be aware of your orders in this Chicken Fillet location Fort Pierce Florida.   The service is still friendly, but the food is never right and always cold or raw."
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,Love this place! Chicken is great! Customer service couldn’t be better!
www.chick-fil-a.com,4,"but the people that work there, and run Chick-Fil-a. Most people have given this place low reviews because of the people's views. I disagree with Chick-Fil-a's views as well, but I don't go to Chick-Fil-a because of their views on gay people, I eat there because their food is good. when the employees begin degrading the people they believe are homosexual, I'll change my review."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,I went recently Chick-fil-A in Raleigh North Carolina on Falls of the Neuse Road I was told this Chick-fil-A top of the line it was the worst Chick-fil-A I've been to my food was cold to the point that I kick Andrews robbery are fries with cold and I got a half a glass lemonade with tea do not go to this Chick-fil-A
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Great service, on-time delivery and provide a chicken broast packet."
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,"I have never had a bad experience at Chick-fil-A and I’ve been eating there for 45 years when it was just at the mall.  I tried to get my husband to invest in a franchise when they were more affordable 15 years ago, but he had never eaten at Chick Fil-A because they weren’t available where he lived.  He just blew off my suggestion.  Now my husband loves the Chick and regrets not taking my advice.  My favorite always will be the chicken sandwich, waffle fries and frosted lemonade or lemonade.  Years ago they had these tiny brownies with nuts sprinkled on top. Please bring those back!I truly believe any bad reviewer is hating Chick-Fil-A because of their Christian values and that’s just a waste of time because when I go to Chick-fil-A the car line usually has 30 cars, so nobody’s fooled by the fake bad reviews.  They should keep it positive and write good reviews on the businesses that share their woke values."
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,All great things to say about Chick-Fil-A.!I have never had a bag experience. Best fast food ever.!
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"We were excited to see the Chicken Tortilla Soup on the menu.   The flavor was very good however the soup had an excessive amount of hot spices, probably cayanne pepper.   We found it impossible to eat."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Store Winston Salem hanes mall blvd gave me the wrong order. I called we care, guess what they don’t. Was supposed to get a refund for the $18.23 I orderyand got a $12.00 order that was someone elses. Location didn’t call or email and the we don’t care line didn’t either. Stay away they are the worst!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,I do not understand the low reviews. The food is amazing. The service is amazing. The way they are able to keep these insanely long lines moving at a good clip is AMAZING. If they were a public company I would invest every dollar I had into them they are just that well run. I am truly amazed that they are getting anything less than a 5 star review. What exactly are yall expecting???
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Ok they have changed the menu and their attitude from good to bad!! I was very angry and didn't eat here at all for a few years. Well I discovered the ice dream is a great pick me up from a bad mood literally! Just like a kid. Problem is I'm not a kid and All they give you is a kiddie cone at regular sized prices. Woman authority person tried to give me a cone so small a new born would be mad! They didn't fix it and threw away that sad little cone wasting while so many go with out. So they had to do was add more but they'd rather waste.  Yet they put in a beer than you personally but don't vibe it out anymore! Nice to nasty!
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,I recently used the Chick-Fil-A app for curbside pickup.  Warning - Chick-Fil-A's app does not default to a restaurant nearest to your location like other fast food apps that I use.   This is a problem!  I just showed up at the wrong restaurant.  Service people were courteous and money was refunded.  But the app needs to be fixed!  I don't have time to read small print while driving.  It is unsafe!
www.chick-fil-a.com,5,There services is the best! I did a mobile order carry out and wen I got my food I had everything I needed in my bag like condiments napkins and straws.. I also experienced the friendliness and the team were working and pushing food out. Thank you chic FIL a on college dr. Baton rouge la....

www.chick-fil-a.com,4,"Excellent! The only complaint I have is the line at 2:00 pm., the cost was pretty high to me, but you have to taste it before you rate it. It wasn’t too anything but good! It’s a great place to go if you want something good to be picked up! So I give it a 9. Quality was awesome! Thanks!"

www.chick-fil-a.com,4,"I love this place, great food, quality, and customer service. Their fries used to be good, now they're just okay. Make sure people look at whose order it is if you're doing a pick up order! This stupid lady just walked out of her truck and took our food without looking at the name."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Hello, my brother is Don. I worked with him for a bit but after what he has done to our family I'm afraid we have disowned him. Don has crossed the line and assaulted every member of our family. I have told him of how people hate him and he called me a slur. Don will be punished do not worry. As for chick fil a itself, hiring Don is a 1 star immediately."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Food is absolutely disgusting. Soggy wet fries I have received twice. Chicken burger tastes like rubber. Donner meat is decent but damn are they stingy with the portion looks like someone has already eaten half of it. Chicken is dry and tasteless make sure u order loads of sauce if you even want to attempt it. Staff are rude, didn’t receive an order they didn’t bother helping just put the phone down and stopped answering. Was late every other order. Only decent thing was the canned drink. Wouldn’t advise getting this cheap nasty food from rude staff"

www.chick-fil-a.com,5,"For the two Chick-fil-a locations near me, I'm blown away by how consistently good they are. The food and orders are always correct, the app works quite flawlessly and the team is very courteous and competent. I have been to other locations that I'd only give a 4 out of 5 but that isn't my experience.I grab a breakfast bowl maybe 2 or 3 times a week and cobb salad or chicken nuggets for lunch/dinner one or two times per week.I've always felt more than safe during COVID.Hands down - a well run organization that give great service, food and experience."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,West Tennessee Street.  Wendy one of the store Manager very disrespectful. Feels she is very racists. Walks off when she see a black person needs help. All workers standing around. Just not good customer service. Need to treat everyone fairly.
www.chick-fil-a.com,2,"Went to try chick fil-a again,  giving it another try. Cause the last 2 have been cold or just yuck taste. So many workers in small work area, behind the ONE & only cashier, must be about 10 people floating around. Waiting about 45 min total, cause they got our order wrong, trying to eat chicken sandwich but bun keeps falling apart. Bathrooms were so dirty & unkept. What's the big hype on this place. Was ok but not great. Won't go again. 9-25-21, about 3pm"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"After getting home I realized they missed 4 items I had ordered.  Living 45 + minutes away, I called and notified them, asking for a refund.  They have repeatedly refused to offer a refund (of over $22 of missing items) unless i drive 45+ minutes (one way) to their store.  I do not live close enough to want their coupons. The manager Carl and owner ray emmerling were so disrespectful over the phone I will never go back to this store.   4 days following event and repeated refusals to refund, I am now having to work with the bank to dispute the charges which is completely unnecessary if they only had good customer service - this could have been resolved same day as transaction.  Even when calling corporate they too said how this is being handled by local owner is not the experience or way they want their customers treated."

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"Me and my family have had so many horrible experience's at Chick Fil A. This time we got only four packets of mayo after we asked to get some for the four members of my family. That's even after we ask for a lot. Then, we got the wrong drinks, and didn't get the amount of chicken nuggets we ordered.Another time me and my family got made fun of by the employees for asking for a bunch of mayo and said a rude comment while we were right by them. We only ask for a bunch of mayo because we like the mayo a lot and have a whole family to feed. And even offered to pay extra and still got made fun of. We don't ask for a bunch to be rude.All me and my family want is to be able to order a meal in peace without any problems, but that certainly will not happen at Chick Fil A. It would be more pleasurable to get good customer service. They do not deserve to have us as customers."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,I came here for a good meal and something to frekin eat! All I got was a PLATE FULL OF DOG SHHIT FROM SOMEONE FROM THE ONE AND ONLY DON.

Very disgusting and I will never be returning to Chick fuclay. Fuc you and your restaurant

www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"The Rocky River location is absolutely horrible.  They just charged my husband for another customer's order.  My husband said that was the wrong amount then the made him pay a second time and was told the first amount would be refunded right away... Over $60 for an order of nuggets and 2 sandwiched and a drink we didn't even get!  Was told AFTER he was charged twice that the refund would take a few ""business days!??  This ""business"" if you can even call it one should have not charged him twice and should have given him a $12 credit for his next visit!! $60 for an unprofessional pile of excuses!!!"

www.chick-fil-a.com,3,"I can't believe I  drove all the way there to use my free gift card you all gave me, for the employee to tell me it's expired. I ask to speak to the manager and he refuse to let me talk to a manager. So I drove off and said that will be the last time I'll be there. You all want miss me you all have plenty of customers!"

He then called me the f-slur then called me a fat Asian pig. Then said to go where I came from and don't spread the corona. I refused then he released a rat army. Then there was a cockroach army released then the rat and cockroaches jumped on me and attacked me, then I got sick and got bowel cancer. If only I just got my Egg white grill and just that this wouldn't of happened. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER GET DON FIRED HE IS DISRESPECTFUL! HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER!"

He yanked at them and threw me outside onto the sidewalk, after I left he tapped me on grindr and proceeded to ask for pics."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I've heard about Don, and they were all right about him! Me and my mother were hungry so we finally decided to get something to eat. We went to the nearest Chick FIL-A and then went in line to order. The cashier's name was Don and immediately recognized my mom. He said hey to her and then commented that last time they slept together she didn't look like a fat rhino. Of course as any daughter would do, I defended my mom. He then commented how my hair looked like a rats nest and grabbed some complimentary rats and threw them at me. My mom freaked out and then insulted Don. Don then stuck out the middle finger and commented how my mother has penis breath. He then took our order after awhile and then went to search for a table. Don then walked behind us and my 97 year old grandmother walked in with us. He then proceeded to dropkick her and said ""Your grandma's a  hoe."" Then spat on us. Never coming back!"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,so i decide to go to chic fil a and as soon as i walk in i see a line of centipedes in the corner. i decide to stay however because there is nothing else near where i was. im eating my food and non other then manager don comes up to me and calls me a fat slut and proceeds to put his dick in my chicken nuggets. he then spits in my drink and tells me that he hopes my whole family dies. he then played david dobrick apology videos on the tv and says if i dont watch he will pee in my eyes... i am absolutely tramatized and will NOT be coming back.
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I don’t normally write reviews but there is a man who was working at this Chick-fil-A named Don who called me a fat cow while I was very much into my pregnancy. I ordered my food and Don put laxatives in my drink, not only was that in my drink there was also rat limbs in my coke. Me not knowing that was in my drink, I drank it and then I started to have very explosive diarrhea.. this causing me to birth my child in a Chick-fil-A drive through that was also very nasty. Don then took my newborn child from me after snapping for his army of roaches. Don would not let me se my child and then said really rude things to me, some of which being the f-slur and calling me a pig for the second time. He then continued to hold my child for ransom! It has been a month and I have still never seen my child. I don’t even know the gender… now that I think about it they never even gave me my Chick-fil-A sauce😕"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"So I’ve never been to Chick-Fil-A before, so I went to check the reviews, only to discover that all Chik-Fil-A’s had a racist and homophobic employee named Don who liked dropkicking people. Now I’m naturally an optimist, so I was hopeful that maybe these were just a few bad experiences (because only 67% of customers left one star, that’s barely above zero after all!) out of many. So I went to my local Chik-Fil-A and was greeted by an employee. Looking at his name tag, I realized his name was Don! I remained hopeful, and we bonded over our matching wallets (it looked exactly like mine! We even had the same credit card number and everything!), except when I went to pay, I realized my wallet was missing! I was so embarrassed, but Don assured me it would be okay. When my order, I looked at the tray and saw it was completely empty. When I asked Don for the food I ordered things took a very bad turn and he spit in my face! He started calling me hurtful names and told me I was a “greedy, fat b!tch” for wanting the food I ordered. He even accused me of lying in order to get more food! And although I’m nice, I’m not a pushover so naturally I tried to stand up for myself. But then he whistled and a bunch of rats came out and knocked me unconscious! When I woke up they were carrying me to to a a dark area that was only lit by a few white candles. At first I thought it was maybe a nice candle-lit dinner from Don as an apology for his rude behavior (but he’s kinda cute and I think he had a crush on me and that’s why he was so mean—he was just teasing!), but then I realized it was a sacrificial, demon-summoning ritual! And I tried to kick the rats away but then I realized my legs were missing! I looked around and watched as Don put them in a meat grinder labeled “chicken nuggets.” The rats laid me in the middle of the circle of candles and began dancing. Soon roaches came and and they also began dancing! I don’t remember much after that because Don spit in my face and stabbed me 79 times. Didn’t get my milkshake though :/"
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"It was terrible, I ordered a chicken sandwich and Don came out and called me the f slur and I told him to go die, he summoned a rat army and told them to eat my toes off, I ran out the window. I DO NOT want anyone to go here."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,When I went to order some fries a rat ran under my table and when I finally got my order don spat it in and he breath was stunky🐒
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,"I would give it 0 stars if I could, I was sitting there right eating with my boyfriend the food wasn't good and some guy named Don came out of the back he started farting while cleaning the table next to us, then started to lick the table. He then made his way to our table then asked if we were enjoying our food, before we could answer he put me in a chokehold and said ""Jhon Cena"" he then proceeded to make out with my boyfriend, my boyfriend now has aids and is emotionally scarred."
www.chick-fil-a.com,1,Don dropped my food on the ground and told me that if I don’t eat it off the ground I will have to get kicked out by an army of rats and roaches I told him no and to square up he then forced me into a closet like Harry Potter and fed me sewer water ice cubes for 3 days Don’t eat here ever don is a dick

carlsjr.com,5,"Great service excellent quality, and of course the personal are friendly ,..I love it"
carlsjr.com,5,This review is for Hastings Carl Junior. Today we had exceptional customer service over and beyond what you would expect from a fast food chain.
carlsjr.com,1,"I just had the worst burger I've ever bitten in to. I remember enjoying the $6 burger for $3.99, but now the famous Dry as a Desert Bone $10 special actually left me angry. Another American product that should be run up someone's flagpole. Never again and not recommended👎"
carlsjr.com,5,MAX QUALITY FOODVærd at vente på!Smager godt.Super god milkshake. Ægte is!Mums fili baba 🤤😃🥳
carlsjr.com,2,"Ordered a meal combo with still water. Did  not want soda or order milky drinks for additional £3 ( not my kind of beverage). Meal brought to table, was then asked if I wanted anything else. Umm where is the bottled water. Oh you ordered that, checks bill, yes, oh you ordered at Kiosk yes. Oh you can have some water from over there or any soda. But I ordered a combo with still water. Now I’m told oh we have no still water. Goes to check at till , was pointed to the soda dispenser again. Only after clearing the table did I get a proper acknowledgment. The nonchalance is main point here.The fries and jalapeño chicken sandwich were good."
carlsjr.com,5,the big carl is the best one i think that's the only one I get
carlsjr.com,5,"I had an amazing experience at Carl's Jr. Thanks to the exceptional service provided by employee Adriana From the moment I walked in,she greeted me with a smile she was tending both areas in the front and drive through and I still felt her honest warm smile and made me feel welcome.Her positive attitude attention to detail,and professionalism truly stood out. Friendly but also efficient. My order was correct 💯 and quickly.you can tell she takes pride in her work and genuinely cares about customer satisfaction. Even during busy time all the pressure one coworker calling her I thought she was going to loose it but she stayed calm, organized and courteous to every guest."
carlsjr.com,2,"Brisbane. Delivery via doordash to a hotel.First time trying this, I'm from another state and I'm away for work and just thought I'd try it. There's a Carl's close to where in live in Victoria, has been there for 1+ years but never been interested to try.Overall, the food tastes like microwaved hungry jacks, so it's not very good. I did not detect any particular flavour from the beef, but I can clearly tell it's rubbery and microwaved or pre heated or similar etc. not good. the burger buns are quite noticeably sweet also I thought, which I don't like at all. Processed cheese that was in no way melted on any burger, so whatever order they are doing things... It's not right. Chips tasted like...chips.soft drink cups massively filled with ice.Overall it's a no, I wouldn't do this again"
carlsjr.com,1,"I ordered breakfast through the app, but they didn’t have the item available. They didn’t cancel my order, didn’t refund my money, and I went all the way there only to still be hungry. And there’s not even a way to get in touch with them."
carlsjr.com,5,I went thru the drive thru at the craig and lossee location and was helped by a nice man by the name of Jullian. He was very friendly and awesome  :)
carlsjr.com,5,"I've been patronizing my local Carl Jr's restaurant in the Gateway area of NE Portland for almost two decades.Their manager, Rudy, greets everyone w/ a ""Hi! How are you?"" His greeting comes across as sincere, unlike the zero-enthusiasm, muttered greeting one receives upon entering any of the Subway locations: ""Welcome to Subway..."", like they are required to say that, but their voices show they don't mean it.I worked @ a McDonald's in high school for over two years, some 50+ years ago! I rarely go there anymore due to what I feel is a lack of quality-tasting food items, other than their french fries.Carl Jr's french fries are also quite tasty, but a grill-cooked burger patty from McDonald's can't match the taste of a char-broiled patty!I have been to many fast-food restaurants around the US over 50 years & find that Rudy, the manager @ this particular location, makes one feel glad they have entered their business more so than all the others I have purchased food items at.He has never failed to offer that genuine, happy greeting each & every time I have patronized this location.Maria, the main staff member on day shift, who takes both drive-through & front-counter orders, is also a cheery personality who appears to also love her job helping customers @ their Carl Jr's.I LOVE the char-broiled flavor that Carl Jr's has for their burgers. Many times as I drive-through (mostly), when asked by either Rudy or Maria as to how I'm doing, I tell them my day will be much better after I have one of their Breakfast Burgers!Carl Jr's Breakfast Burger is delicious! The miniature hash browns combine w/ an egg, American cheese & bacon strips, adds much to the wonderful taste of one of their char-broiled burger patties, placed neatly on a sesame-studded hamburger bun.If one orders the double Breakfast Burger ($1.50 additional over the regular, single patty), one has two of those BBQ-like patties, a fulfilling meal that lasts me up through lunch time!Both Rudy & Maria ask me if I'm sure I don't want to order their Breakfast Burger on the few occasions I happen to occasionally order a different menu item!I rarely write restaurant reviews. This Carl Jr's location on NE Halsey & 102nd, in NE Portland, OR, is a sure bet for tasty food, any time of the day, fulfilled by courteous staff members such as Rudy & Maria."

carlsjr.com,1,I ordered my food on the mobile app because I was in a hurry. When I got there I asked for the restroom code. The woman behind the counter ignored me and I had to ask for it several times! After I used the restroom I came out and told her I had a mobile order. It then took another 15 to 20 minutes for me toget my food. Horrible customer service and the cook gave me a dirty look!! She then proceeded to make everybody's order that came in and made me wait. So disrespectful!! I will never go there again!!! 😔 That was the first time I used the app and it was for my birthday. What a disappointment!!!!
carlsjr.com,1,The Henderson (Lincoln Road) store short my order even after going back because it was short a side order! They removed fries when giving me the side order. Check your order in-store! They are not honest!
carlsjr.com,1,"The Carl's jr on Garden of the Gods sucks. I ordered from their app was missing a whole burger and since it was a delivery from door dash I was told to contact them. The back was taped shut so It was Carl's job to put everything in the bag. Long story short both door and Carl's Jr said they couldn't refund me. I'm like that's stealing and I even tipped the dasher. People are getting more and more rude these days no empathy, sympathy or compassion geez. Won't ever go back there.Last time I ordered there they give me the bun and left off the whole burger patty. This place sucks and the manager is always rude!! 🤬"

carlsjr.com,1,So I pulled up to the drive thru to order dinner. AI is now talking to you over the speaker. The car infront sat for over 10 minutes without getting any food. Truck behind us backed up and left and so did we. AI is taking away from jobs and it's completely wrong! All my reviews are positive except for this one. Guess there's always a first

""No cheese"".It was not until we were back on the freeway and I bit into my sandwich that I realized it contained a ton of cheese.  BTW, my French fries tasted like zucchini. I did not care for that either."

Guy didn’t bother to knock or ring the doorbell.  Half the order items were missing or wrongly sized.Rang them and spoke to the most unhelpful, rude, obstinate, obnoxious and obstructive “manager“ I have ever encountered called Dianne who basically told me it wasn’t her problem that the order was wrong, missing items or cold.  Apparently I was to take it up with Uber Eats.  When I informed her I ordered from them directly and not via Uber Eats her solution was for me to “fill out a feedback form”.  No offer to remedy or send the items I paid for but never got.Like WTAF Carl’s Jnr?!!Well here is my feedback for you guys.  I will NEVER again buy anything from you again.  N.E.V.E.R."
carlsjr.com,1,"Terrible Work EnvironmentWorking at Carl's Jr.  Rotorua has been one of the worst experiences of my life. The food quality is awful, and customers constantly complain about it, but management refuses to take responsibility or make improvements.The manager is rude, unprofessional, and completely dismissive of both staff and customer concerns. They create a toxic environment where employees feel undervalued and disrespected. There’s no support or proper training, and shifts are chaotic because of poor management.I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone—neither as a customer nor as an employee."

The manager even called over her shoulder as she handed me my food and asked the cook if it was the Impossible Burger. That was at 3:09 p.m. today.Where am I now? I’m in severe pain, but it’s going to get a while lot worse before it gets better. Unfortunately, this just isn’t a risk I’ll be taking again.

I didn’t want anything, just letting them know so they could tell their supplier."

She is an A+ employee!  She is respectful to senior citizens (us).  We love this venue. I have enjoyed probably 40 different Carl's Jr. Stores, but this one is the best.  La is an incredibly hard worker.  She deserves a pat on the back!"
carlsjr.com,1,"went to the drive through in Atascadero CA  at 3:00 pm no body in the drive through ahead of me. lady quoted me the right price and ran my card and gave me a recipte. shortly then came back and said she charged me for the previous order and wouldnt give me my food unless i let her run my card and charge me again. as i said there was nobody in the line ahead of me. so i gave her my card cause i was hungry and needed to eat,i am diabetic. she ran my card AGAIN and it was for a differant amount then my original order then the manager came over and she was rude and dismisive of my concerns. she then produced a recipte that wasnt mine and said see its all ok. but it wasn't my recipte. i know what happened their drawer was short from an error earlier  and they didnt want to explain it to their district manager so they just figured they would charge someone extra to cover their mistake. Carl's Jr should be renamed Crooked Jr. bunch of crooks working in Carl's Jr.. and if it was their error they didnt even give us a free dessert or anything for their mistake. and to top it off the chicken tenders were cold and hard as were the fries. not even worth a single charge on my card let alone a double charge."

carlsjr.com,5,Customer service isn't always about great customer service.  Yesterday right after a devastating dr appointment I went there with my husband.  Two managers Irene n Judith new something was wrong n both were there for me in a short time . Like I Said it's not always about a hot burger. Sometimes the simplest things leave the most permanent marks on someone's heart
carlsjr.com,1,Food far too salty. The teriyaki chicken was uneatable. Sad.
carlsjr.com,1,If I could give a 0 I would.We went to the Carls Junior in terminal 3 Harry Reid airport before we caught our flight home to the UK. Was served by Danielle who before served me was speaking to other employees appalling not sure if she was a manager but retraining is definitely required if so. Danielle was very rude to me when she served me I hadn’t finished ordering and she cut me off twice by interrupting me to the point I had to tell her to stop being so rude to me and to let me finish my order- a work colleague next to Danielle had to tell her to relax and that I hadn’t finished my order. Danielle was very rude and abrasive when I mentioned about her behaviour and I had to ask her to let me finish talking - myself and my partner were disgusted by her behaviour and when I was waiting for my food she was saying to her colleagues ‘I’m not rude I’m just abrasive and not everyone can take that’ I’m sorry but if that is the kind of person you want serving customers then you need to rethink because the way I was spoken to was absolutely disgusting and was the only bad experience about my whole trip to vegas. I will give a special mention to the other lady who’s name I didn’t have for apologising on Danielle’s behalf for that behaviour but again it shouldn’t have happened and customers should not be spoken to like that.Never again.
carlsjr.com,1,"I had ordered a Dr Pepper with my meal at the Carl's Jr location in Big Bear Lake, CA.  When I tasted my drink I discovered that they gave me a diet Dr Pepper.  Not a big deal, but I asked them to replace it with the correct drink.  The employee at first argued with me that it was the correct soda.  Then argued that ""that's just how it tastes"" as if I've never drank a Dr Pepper before in my lifetime.  He stormed away and gave me a sample  to supposedly prove it, but this time he actually gave me the correct one.  This seemed to annoy him more and he ultimately replaced the diet with the regular Dr Pepper, but he didn't feel the need to apologize for the mistake or his behavior.It's completely inappropriate behavior so I felt the need to contact Carl's Jr about it.  I learned that even though I found a customer service phone number online, that they apparently don't staff that phone at all and require all complaints to their website.  The response I received from the website was an unapologetic copy and paste response that claimed that someone would contact me.  It's been a month as of today and not one attempt has been made to contact me.  Clearly Carl's Jr is okay with poor customer service on both the store and corporate levels."

The man at the window repeated my order but said ""two double Diablo Hamburgers, that will be Eighteen Dollars."" I forget the amount of the change he quoted. I said ""No I was two single patties for $5.99 each like the ad running on the television said. He replied ""Not at this place."" I then ask to speak to a Manager and was told the Manager wasn't there until tomorrow. Then he told me if I wasn't ordering anything I should leave the property or he was going to call the police. I drove to the next Carl's Jr. in Westminister and ordered the same thing with no problem and the price was as advertized. I came home and called the place I had the problem with to ask for the Managers name. The lady who answered the phone her name she said was ""Cane."" She ask me why I needed to speak to a Manager so I told her what occured. She told me the Manager's name was Christina Sanchez.

carlsjr.com,2,"Good food, but they weren't very good at taking my order. I had to repeat everything three times and correct the drink at the window, and still got the wrong food. It was good, but I would have much preferred if it were what I'd ordered.I refuse to mention a store branch, employee, or even what specifically I ordered, and furthermore I'm deliberately providing the wrong date, because I don't blame the people working there one bit and I refuse to let Carl's Jr. blame them either. Corporate is taking the blame for this one. Grumpy, I asked myself incredulously how they could get my order wrong after they'd made me repeat it so many times to them, but then I reminded myself I already know the answer: they're overworked, underpaid, they probably don't sleep enough, and they're mentally and socially exhausted from spending all day every day standing around in a cramped, sweltering little cubicle and transcribing complicated lists shouted at them through a tin can.Sure, that may be the norm of the genre, but that doesn't make it excusable. If fast food companies want to step up their game and actually provide passable service, the first step is to stop treating their employees like caged monkeys."

carlsjr.com,1,"May 4, 2024, at 2:36 pm. This is the worst place I have ever been. My food was wrong to start with. By the time I started to open my burgers, without warning, the general manager came and grabbed my sandwich. I have to chase him down to get some explanation. The general manager, yes, the general manager, tried to sell my 11-year-old  son a side of BBQ sauce for $0.25. Then, when I stepped in, he changed the price to $0.35 and had the courage to tell me that he's doing us a favor because the side BBQ sauce cost $0.50 and went to argue with me for about 10 minutes. If the owner of this franchise wants his investment to survive, he should, in my opinion, retrain his workers, or Carl's Junior is going down."

carlsjr.com,1,"We had lunch delivered, costing over $60 for 2 medium burger combos and some chicken tenders. (Using UberEats)For that price I was expecting quality, freshly made burgers.Instead the patties are processed and tasteless, cardboard would taste better. The bun and pitiful salad were soggy, everything was cold (even though delivery was fast - so already cold in-store).It was revolting! We ended up throwing it in the bin, it wasn’t edible.If you want processed rubbish, you’re better off going to Hungry Jacks or Macca's (they actually taste better) and save a heap of money."

carlsjr.com,5,"Before savoring Carl's Jr.'s famous hamburger, we will have built up high expectations based on the rave reviews. And as a lover of good food, I can't help but praise the exceptional experience Carl's Jr. provides, especially when it comes to their Famous Star burger and irresistible fries.The Famous Star is simply extraordinary. The juiciness of the meat combined with the unique flavor of the special sauce gives it an unparalleled taste. The melted cheese blends harmoniously, elevating each bite to a sublime culinary experience. The freshness of the ingredients is evident, and the consistency in the quality of this burger is impressive. Without a doubt, it is a feast for the senses.The fries, a little salty, but the perfect match for the Famous Star. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, these delicacies perfectly complement the flavor of the burger.In short, Carl's Jr. has become my favorite fast food."

carlsjr.com,1,15 bucks for chicken strips?! you must be kidding... not to mention all the employees look like they're on suicide watch. you'd think with the prices you have the nerve to charge you could pay your workers a decent wage. I can't wait til you go out of business.
carlsjr.com,1,"I used to love Carl’s Jr. they used to be really good, here in Madera in the corner of country club.I bought a burrito this morning and the tortilla was hard like they just took it out of the bag and wrapped it up ,but the time I got to work ,it was just horrible.I got coupons in the mail, so I said, why not give it another try and bought me a famous star.It was horrible. They put old beat up lettuce in my burger and didn’t taste the same..While I was there, I told the manager hey remember me I bought a burrito this morning.That was hard and it wasn’t good , I said the truth andI never complain, but I was waiting for her to make it right. She didn’t say anything without a care in the world.That I had complaint for the first time ever .That’s fast food for you. self note ;people that make fast food just don’t care , be careful what you eat .Well, I go back probably, next time I’ll just March right up in there.And say hey, make it right 😏"

carlsjr.com,1,My wife and I arrived at your Ballarat outlet at 10pm as we knew that the store was open until 11pm. The door was locked and one of the people inside grudgingly came to the door after blatantly ignoring us for about 3 minutes. We were told that the shop was closed for cleaning. We pointed out to the employee that the sign on the door said the store was open from 8am to 11pm on Friday and Saturday. We also told him that we had been travelling and wanted a meal. Not a chance. Just to put you in the picture we visit your Ballarat outlet frequently as we live close to Ballarat and it is our preferred fast food. We are seriously considering boycotting all your outlets after this demonstration of your customer service. If this is representative of your standard of service then you have some serious problems. My wife and I operate our own food truck so we actually have a working knowledge as to how to give excellent customer service. You people have some serious issues.

carlsjr.com,5,The Employee Araceli was very helpful and understanding.
carlsjr.com,1,I just went through the drive through. food was average..all you could task was the sauce..all 3 burgers were unsatisfing..Customer service was lovely.
carlsjr.com,1,"Customer service with drive through was poor as not friendly at all… I had one of their chicken burger meals with bacon… burger looked like it was slapped together, bacon definitely undercooked, fries luke warm like the burger and I ended up with food poisoning… I have been ill for hours now… i will never go back there again… it was at the Molendinar branch in QLD…"
carlsjr.com,1,I stopped by on my way to church and tried the sausage egg cheese biscuit it was not good. Much too salty. Your food seems to get worse and more expensive. if you want our business you should try harder.  Purchased from Carl's Jr. on 40 St. San Bernardino.
carlsjr.com,2,"I have been asking for a clarification of Carl's Jr's policy concerning ""Senior Discounts"". Their website say that it's given and I get it sometimes but NOT when the manager is at the register. According to him, the meal is already ""cheap"".I have sent several emails to their customer service as their phone number is ""non-operational""! I keep getting a response that I will take about 2-3 business days to get a response but IT NEVER COMES!"

The bun is twice the size of the thin chicken patty about 3.5"" and sliced then..I can't reach any line to tell them. It goes in circles.Its frustrating..just my sandwich was $8 plus tax!!So will dispute with cc and I have the pic. The chicken stars hardly have meat. All crust and dry. This is why I eat at home . My cooking is bomb and yes groceries are high but I can use as much or little to make dinner and have left Iver's. Everyone enjoys it.  The burger my daughter was so so."
carlsjr.com,1,"I would like to say You are advertising the Diablo Burger and Diablo means "" Devil "" and then the price is $6.66 The number 666 is used to signify the devil Mark of the beast. So as it stands you are selling the devil burger and charging the people the mark of the beast number 666 I would never do that seems like now you business is leaning toward the devil side. Selling  "" El Diablo"" The devil burger for $6.66.  I use to shop at Carls Jr but as long as you are selling el diablo burger and pricing it at the mark of the beast 666 I will not shop there until the devil burger is removed."

When I gave my order (at 10:41 in the morning) no customers were there.  No one was inside, or in the drive-thru, but me... so clearly they were NOT busy in the slightest.  I chose Carl's over nearby options because I had never had a ""bad"" experience... until now.I paid, then drove to the side back lot to eat and found to my disgust that the $7.89 burger meal was what I must term ""cold""... as if it had ""maybe"" been cooked earlier (or the day before?) and was left to chill out on some counter.  There was **no** warmth to the sandwich at all, even the cheese was congealed.  The texture of the bread gave the impression it was indeed old... at least 1/2-1 day old.  The fries were JUST EVER SO SLIGHTLY warm... basically, ""cold"" and flimsy.  I had to toss my lunch in the can, except for the drink - which not surprisingly now, tasted watered down - and I left the back lot quite upset at this experience - and HUNGRY!Debating about reporting the facility, I did end up contacting Carl's Jr/CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. June 7th by email via THEIR site, and waited... but was left hanging with this msg: ""We received your feedback and are working with our teams to better serve you."" - - -REALLY?!   A total ""blow-off""?!I have since contacted them several more times to ask why they aren't responding directly to me.As example, June 17th I wrote:{ Dear whomever, So still just hanging here…No input from you, no call,  no personal response or email, no replacement coupons, nothing…Is this the customer service platform you're now doing business under? It's the afternoon of the 17th… Just wondering if I am going to hear back from you folks? Thanks }Carl's has gone WOKE apparently with an 'I don't give a damn' attitude toward even it's vintage customers... and they have *not* gone out of their way to contact me further (Yes, they have my email and T# and address)Well too big for your britches head-in-the-sand CJ operatives, and not that you care one bit (clearly you don't), but word-of-mouth is a POWERFUL agent and you have now lost a decades old customer (and family!) by acting as stone cold as your wannabe ""customer service and fresh food"".  Observing your HIGHLY unprofessional treatment of the situation, I can say we (which is several families these days) will never again go to a Carl's.  BTW: We share this story whenever we can so others know what kind of company CJ's *really* is.  YOU LOSE, not us.WARNING TO OTHERS: The CJ employees knew EXACLY what they were giving me... so there is no excuse possible for what they did... Just as there is no excuse acceptable for corporate to totally ignore this situation.  I can not speak for other working folks, but in this day and age of managerial gutlessness in the business sectors, I choose *not* to give patronage to ANY institution which goes out of their way to both: fail AND ignore me.  No company is too big to come crashing down once the public has had enough.  Shame on you all - good riddance!"

carlsjr.com,1,"This company is guilty of not only raising prices, they are also taking part in the scummy practice of decreasing portion sizes. The price goes up on a weekly basis, and they still decided to give customers less food than they paid for just the previous week. What utter scum."
carlsjr.com,2,"I went to Del Taco on Long Beach Town Center on Carson St. It was a few minutes past open time and the restaurant was still closed. Another gentleman also parked and was waiting with me to enter. I was hungry so I walked to Carl’s Jr. just a few feet from Del Taco, and the man said –“I wouldn’t go in there. That place’s environment is pretty bad. Trust me on this one”–; I didn’t go inside after all.Last night I went to that same Carl’s Jr. with my two adult sons, and a lady with an unusually “long face” and bad attitude took our order. We sat to eat, talk, and have a good time. The music was nice but awfully loud—we couldn’t hear each other—, it looked like this Mexican restaurants with the music blasting incredibly loud that I so much dislike and where I obviously don’t return (I am Mexican), so I went to ask politely if they could lower the volume to a comfortable level and that same rude woman said that couldn’t be done because that is the way the system is programmed. Which we all know it is a lie!We rushed eating our food and left the place very disappointed.The restaurant was clean but we felt uncomfortable with the experience.I love Carl’s Jr. but I hated this specific restaurant!"

Asked raspberry, no plain, oh ok. Next order placed. At window, handed a raspberry ice tea, said no, ordered plain. She says I don't have plain. I said I can't stand that crap. Do you have coke zero, her, yes, ok I'll take that, get a coke. Burger not a lettuce wrap. Her attitude was basically she doesn't give a crap. I ordered this way for health reasons. Gluten issues and sugar processing. So sorry for other customers trying to eat healthy at a fast lousy food place."

However  I noticed the meat started being dry and the BBQ sauce wasn't the same, so I stopped eaten at Carls Jr restaurant. So, after 10 years I decided to give Carls Jr one more chance. I was highly disappointed. The customers service at 4805 Watt Ave  North Highlands ca, 95660 was great. Monica the cashier was nice and polite. I order a spicey chicken sandwich and Fried Zucchini. I would have to saw. The chicken looked and tasted like something you would eat out of an elementary school cafeteria. I figured with all the fast food eateries coming out with all the great chicken sandwich Carls Jr what have step there. The game up. The spicey chicken sandwich need to be pulled off the menu. The chicken is gross."

Put it in our dogs dish, and he just sniffed it and left it.  That seriously meant it was bad!!!!  Not had good luck at this location the last two times I've been here.  Heber City Location.

carlsjr.com,5,"Carl's Jr. is a San Diego based family restaurant chain that has a location in Brawley, California. The local restaurant serves the most delicious Beyond Meat Carl's hamburgers! I ask that the patties be grilled a little longer, making the patty taste a little more like meat.   Adding some Jalapenos to the burger and skipping the cheese is a nice option.   Hint, fill out their opinion survey found on the back of the receipt to receive the customer survey code for a two for one burger offer.  Yum, two grilled Vegan burgers for one price, equating to two meals for one person.   Thank you!"

She made my husband pay 2x last time which came out to be $60 for two meals . And she still got it wrong. She had attitude that was just so ugly. They have also given us hard bread that shouldn’t be served. We give her the benefit of the doubt because it’s so early but come on ! This has happened 4 times. She needs to be removed from that position or fired. She’s incompetent. Dont go to jack in the box on rufe snow during breakfast hours.

We left our cars in their parking lot while we bought something at a nearby store. When we returned to eat, my sister's car was no longer there. We thought it had been stolen. I asked the lady at the restaurant and she got nervous and aggressive. When I went out, they were already trying to take my car. I asked the young man from the tow truck while he was taking 3 more cars and he gave me the address of where they had them. I followed him and we had to pay $270.00 dollars. to be able to get the car out. In addition, the young men from the tow truck company made fun of us and were aggressive. I would not doubt that jackinthebox staff receive a percentage of what is stolen from people (their customers). For that reason, I will not return to those restaurants. I have pictures a the papers.        EDGAR MARTINEZ."

Monster Taco a monstrous disaster, like it’s smaller siblings drenched in old oil most of the times. Have thought of the staff as a revolving door.

jackinthebox.com,1,I ordered Sourdough smashed jack combo online.  I barely ate anything it was gross.  My hamburger had no taste.  Only tasted the pickles and bun.  The French fries are made with old grease.  Only thing that was good was my unsweetened  ice teach.  I paid over $13.
jackinthebox.com,2,What went wrong is the app is horrible for adding or subtracting....i wanted extra pickles on my jumbo jack...didn't buy fries because I need them without salt...on the app you can't request no salt
jackinthebox.com,1,So I tried to order four times from a newbie. Somebody else came on to try and help when I asked her her name she said Janet Jackson. Ain't believing that total disrespect to a 60-year-old person

jackinthebox.com,1,"If I could leave a negative number I would. My app got hacked, and I got an email saying a JIB in California was processing an order (I live in AZ). Nowhere on the app does it have a cancellation feature. I called the JIB in Cali and they either couldn't or wouldn't cancel the order. I forwarded order email to the District Manager and explained the situation and she forwarded it to JIB Customer Service (that's a contradiction in terms if I ever heard one). 5 days later I get an email from JIB basically saying I'm out of luck, I have to file a dispute with my bank. They didn't offer to do anything at all for the trouble I went through, and didn't say anything about trying to fix their app. I have since shut down my app and I now refuse to eat there anymore."

jackinthebox.com,1,"First thing, and most unfortunately, I wasn't able to leave my review on their Website.  I've complained in the past, so perhaps I've been banned?  In any case, I'm even a bit more concerned.  I have never heard back from their manager and/or corporate.  Why???...hmm???  Do they even care???!!!  Overlooking all that, I just purchased an expensive/huge order tonight, and the experience was again deplorable!  Customer service bad. Staff argumentative and only provided four sauces for three meals, even when requested for more.  They simply don't  listen. They simply just don't care. 😞"

jackinthebox.com,1,"The restoration was filthy the employes were just standing around the bathrooms made ya want to vomit.  The food was overcooked to the point of being burnt. This was i#4718,think they need better managers. No one cleaned a table till the next shift came in. Worse $27.32 we ever spent but  won't do it again."
jackinthebox.com,2,I was employed but I got fired for caring for my son while my fiance was sick. I missed 1 day and was late 2 times for staying up at night with my 1 month old. I highly don't recommend employment if you have kids. I even told them at the day of hire I have a son.
jackinthebox.com,1,"No longer a customer. The only thing I ate from there was curly fries and the breakfast platter with sausage though I don't eat meat. Who thought it was a good idea to take the pancakes off and add French toast? It's way sweeter than the pancakes. Y'all started off with 12 little pancakes, then it went to 6 and I kept supporting. But that French toast ain't it. Whoever did that need to be fired, even if it was Jack cause what the hell. Y'all already only got a funky salad for a vegan option..now u take the pancakes off and leave the price the same or went up a bit...NOPE..."
jackinthebox.com,2,They don’t honor their promotion the staff act like they never heard of any thing going on with jack in the box mind you they are posted all over the store rude workers make the food bad I had a very bad experience this past week with the 3 o’clock staff
jackinthebox.com,1,Just once I would like what I ordered to be almost just almost like the photo this is my last time going they haven't changed..very disappointed
jackinthebox.com,1,"Expensive and not at all as advertised in photos on their website.  The Smashed Jack price, just the burger, is $8.59! I wish I could attach a photo of the little burger we got next to the advertised photo.  It should be illegal to so completely misrepresent what they're selling.  Not worth even half the price.  Never again."
jackinthebox.com,1,Stand at the counter not helped twice.  ignore customer at Counter
jackinthebox.com,1,The SLOWEST and most rude costumer service!!! Will NEVER return to this location!!!
jackinthebox.com,1,Horrible service and the food is crap. Old soggy lettuce. Half of my toppings missing. Got the southwest salad no tortilla strips and or tomatoes on my salad.
jackinthebox.com,1,I had run in with management she was bitchy . Rude very dispectful
jackinthebox.com,1,"I ordered two large Sauced and Loaded popcorn chicken combos.  No sauce, no loaded, no toppings of any kind. Nothing.  Bone dry.  No sauce for the onion rings, or the curly fries. Spent almost 50 bucks on bone dry popcorn chicken. Most disappointing food experience ever. 0 out of 10."
jackinthebox.com,1,"Your employee's at Store# 1595 first told me that I had to wait for fries. Didn't give me a receipt for purchase. Had me wait for over 20 min for them. When i went to inquire about it, I was told that i need to calm down about it because they gave it away to somebody else. Then when i asked for a refund I was told they couldn't give a copy of the receipt for the refund. This is what happens when you leave a bunch of high school kids in charge without any adult supervision. By far the worse experience I have ever received at any restaurant. I think my run with your chain has come to a end. I will post this on social media and hope everyone joins in on this."
jackinthebox.com,1,"I was exited to see that Jack in the box is offering bobba tea and coffee. Highly disappointed in the false advertising of how much tapioca is in the drink. In their photos they show a generous amount of it. But it actually came with only one thing layer at the bottom of the cup. Live and learn! I wanted to leave a photo, but apparently this sight doesn't have that capability."
jackinthebox.com,1,"On 2/15/24 I placed an order on their app, as I usually do at least once a week.  I place the order and get confirmation and my card was charged.  I get to the store and they have a sign on the drive thru speaker stating that the store I closed due to being short staffed.  I pull up to the drive thru window and no one is visible in the store, but I was still charged for the food any way.  I have tried contacting their website to get this corrected and have not received any response nor have they refunded the money I was charged."
jackinthebox.com,5,The cashier was very polite & and gave me the Senior discount plus the food was very fresh & she let me know that.

jackinthebox.com,2,"I been hesitating to write a review for about a year but enough is enough, every time you order thru the drive thru, no matter the time of the day, they make you park in front of the store to wait for your order, I been there waiting for a simple hamburger with other 4 cars and they take at least 10 to 15 min to bring out your order, don’t this supposed to be a fast food restaurant, where you mostly go in your 30 min brake?? We have other jack in the boxes around and this is the only restaurant where this has been happening for a long time, it is ridiculous!!"

jackinthebox.com,5,Have had less than par experiences at the Farmington MO jack in the box for the last couple years as they seemed super understaffed and low number of customers.Tonight was like jack in the box of old.  Hot food and good quality.  They still seemed understaffed but managed to keep good quality.  Whoever was working at 7pm on 09/09/23 deserves praise.

jackinthebox.com,2,Decatur and Sahara  drive thru this morning.  Lady almost gave me the wrong order but kept my change of $4.00
jackinthebox.com,1,Rude co workers. And get this apparently they charge 3 dollars for a glass of water. There was no kindness shown to us at all. Alyssa was the lady working there that was of no help and completely not understanding at all. She even slammed the door in our face before we got all of our food. Just plain out rude.
jackinthebox.com,1,It must be nice to give false advertisement and to sell product that looks nowhere remotely close to the false advertisement dictated on a regular basis I buy ultimate bacon cheeseburger only to find paper wafer thin bacon on my sandwich but when you see the advertisement it's got bacon as thick as my finger on the sandwich. Why is it I don't have enough money to sue them for million's of dollars for false advertisement.
jackinthebox.com,2,"Jack in the Vons center on Black Mountain Rd. Stopped for a breakfast Jack and hash browns this morning. Sandwich had the appearance and taste of something that was sitting around for awhile. Hash browns were way under cooked. Went back for a refund and was informed the manager had not informed employees how to do refunds. This situation is clearly at the feet of the manager. As manager you are responsible for the training of your staff. As manager you failed your employees and your customers. The employees present wanted to help however, did not know how to correct the situation. Bad management is the root of underperformance and failure. The manager of this restaurant has failed their company, employees, and customers."
jackinthebox.com,1,"ordered online 3 weeks ago. when I got there, woman tells me that they don't have milkshakes which I've already paid $4.99 for. she doesn't offer a solution. I ask her why she won't give me the $4.99 back and she says I have to contact the Jack in the Box app. I do this and nobody ever replies. today I got an email from Jack in the Box asking me if I am satisfied with how they handled my issue. I checked the box that nobody ever responded at all, which I'm imagining now is probably what happens to anyone who has an issue. How are they still in business?"
jackinthebox.com,1,"Wish I could give 0 stars. I used to love JITB but the last few times it’s been terrible. Their prices have skyrocketed and yet the burgers have shrunk and are super dry, they always mess up the order. Just not worth it. Tried them for the last time to night. Burger King and carls are WAY better if you’re needing fast food. Delicious and actually get what you pay for."
jackinthebox.com,1,"Jack in the Box waters down their sodas. Every Jack in the Box locations I have visited in Southern California has the new soda machine that offers many different types of soda from touching the screen, but compared to every other fast food place or movie theater that has the same type or similar machine, only Jack in the Box sodas have barely any taste. I thought these cartridge based machines were all programmed to mix the sodas to taste just like the syrup fountain machines, but Jack in the Box is altering the mix most likely to maximize the flavor cartridges and save money. On top of this, only Jack in the Box has the highest rate of messing up my orders no matter how many times I have to repeat it, the most unfriendly employees and service all of the drive thru customers before me even though I placed my order way before those customers even arrived. I rarely go to Jack in the Box now and only stop by when the Carl's Jr and Taco Bell nearby haven't opened yet and I'm starving after work and I'm almost home. Jack in the Box needs to focus on training their employees rather than making a new commercial every few weeks."
jackinthebox.com,1,Jack in the box sucks ass and their customer service sucks even more ass. Them asses owe me over 80 dollars in online orders the past year from ordering online and getting there and them mentally incapacitated people told me that they don’t have what I ordered or that their computer system is down so I wait to get a refund which I never get. So honestly screw Jack in the crack eat a dick up is what I say.

jackinthebox.com,1,"Horrible app don't waste your time I've ordered so much and gained so many points, that could never be used!!"
jackinthebox.com,1,"Horrible service! I went at Jack in the Box which is located at 419 Lodi Eve around 7:30 am.  I was doing a drive through . The guy was very rude on the phone. He said he couldn’t hear what I was ordered! My order was very simple! “ two large fries and one crispy chicken ! He told me to lower my window ! Surprisingly when I told him that my window was down, he was able to hear that😳! I decided to go by his window and place my order from there May be he can read my lips! That was every worse! He started to interrogate me! With his red eyes and mean voice he said if I don’t include a soda in my meal then that is not the menu that he can give me! I decided to leave without getting anything! My question is, if this mature male doesn’t even have an ounce of customer service , what’s the point for him to even show up at work? He should find a job which will allow him to humiliate and undermine his customers! In my opinion, this guy is there for a wrong reason."
jackinthebox.com,1,Yes I ordered $39 worth of food and they left out my $7.99 grilled chicken sandwich and it's pretty close to my house the Jack in the Box off of Ben White Austin Texas that I just drove right back and the window was closed up and there was cars there and I tried going through twice but nobody answered the speaker very dissatisfied with this place horrible service! By the way when I got there it was only 9:40 so I'm guessing they closed early cuz no place closes at 9:40 and I thought Jack and the box was supposed to be 24 hours
jackinthebox.com,4,Love the tiny loaded tacos! A flat box would enable them to cover each evenly with lettuce and cheese and sauce instead of piled on the top!
jackinthebox.com,4,"The new app is a nightmare. However .. here is what isn't. On the Door Dash app they offer any sandwich the option of "" no bun "" and it comes lettuce wrapped. Why is this such a big deal ? If you eat gluten free like I do , it matters. My Jack makes no mistakes on orders, offers lots of customization , has the second best Coke fountain mixture , ( McDonalds is #1 ) and offers new stuff all the time. Do I wish they would add some more GF items like fried zucchini like Carls but GF ? yes. Should they add a smoothie like McDonalds ? yes. Should they offer egg bites like Starbucks , yes. For now though, if you are eating fast food , I say Jack tries hard to make things fun and gluten free."
jackinthebox.com,1,"This is the Jack in the box at 6501 grapevine highway in North Richland hills.I ordered a Texas double Jack with tomato, extra onion, extra lettuce, and no mustard.  I received a Texas double Jack with meat cheese and a bun.  The onion rings, which are normally tasty and fresh, arrived cold and hard, as if they were fried, and then fried again to warm them up. I suppose it is possible the onion rings had just been sitting around for a while at the restaurant.The same thing happened to me 2 weeks earlier on or around October 14th, at the store located at 1491 precinct line road, in Hurst texas.On that particular order I complained to Jack in the box, just like I did with this order, and I received a canned response from Jack in The box, the same canned response for both complaints. It goes as follows...Thank you for sending us your feedback. We value your comments and are committed to providing awesome experiences for all our guests.A Jack in the Box representative will be reviewing your feedback. If you provided feedback about a specific restaurant location, your feedback will be sent to the appropriate district manager or owner/operator. This same person would also contact you if you requested to be contacted about your feedback.Thank you and have a terrific day!The Jack in the Box Guest Relations TeamThis canned response isn't signed with anyone's name, no identification of any kind, I'd like to add also no one has ever contacted me from Jack in The box to try to correct the issue.You decide which title fits, corporate monster or local fast food restaurant.Thanks for listening.P. S. I set the date of experience for October the 31st, I've tried to correct it twice, apparently trustpilot is not getting that correct, keep that in mind."
jackinthebox.com,1,"Went to the Ina and freeway store in Tucson and ordered 4 monster tacos.  Was told I could not have them unless I ordered something else.   There was nothing I saw stating there are ""CONDITIONS"" for ordering MT's. Is not mentioned on the TV ads either."
jackinthebox.com,1,I received the app now there's just a blank white page. For that I am no longer coming back to Jack in the Box ever ever again.
jackinthebox.com,1,The new Jack In The Box app. is not great at all! Why change it to something stupid? The old app. was great. I’m not so sure about what other stupid decisions they’ve made recently.  Lost confidence in the brand because of the new app. !
jackinthebox.com,1,Terrible customer service on 4th plain in Vancouver WA. Rude attitude when asking any questions.
jackinthebox.com,1,"THE APP CHANGED OR UPDATED AND BECAME MY WORST NIGHTMARE. I HAD POINTS THAT ARE NO LONGER THERE. NOW I HAVE TO INPUT THE BARCODE BY HAND. IT WAS BETTER BEFORE....WHAT GENIUS THOUGHT LET'S CHANGE IT AND MAKE LESS USER FRIENDLY? I DON'T KNOW BUT SOMETIMES I THINK PEOPLE IN THESE COMPANIES GET WILD HAIRS UP THEIR BUTTS AND DECIDE TO MAKE STUPID DECISIONS HOPING TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR SOMETHING GREAT! IF IT AIN'T BROKE, LEAVE IT ALONE BEFORE YOU BREAK IT! UGH!!! FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT READ THIS, YOU WILL PROBABLY FIGURE OUT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH STUPID PEOPLE AND STUPID THINGS. I'VE HAD DOGS THAT HAVE MADE BETTER DECISIONS.

jackinthebox.com,5,"First time I went to this Jack in the Box there was no one at the register, the young man cooking an order saw me standing there and politely said we'll be right with you mam and his smile was very pleasant. After he finished cooking his order he walked to the counter and said with a welcoming smile how is your day going mam when I said it was going okay he said well let's see if we can't make it ever better and then he kindly excused himself and walked to the left and within 4 seconds another young man was there at the register. Nathan (the cook) said have a great day mam and gave me another happy smile. No matter how busy or how much heat from the grills were this young man went over and above to make my visit well worth it. Because of Nathan, I will be telling all of my friends what a positive experience I had at this Jack in the Box and we shall all continue to visit and eat at the Jack in the Box on North Oracle/River Rd.I hope Nathan reads this review as he truly deserves to be rewarded for his kindness.Thank you NathanSarDea"
jackinthebox.com,2,"The employee I tried to order from didn't even know about a discount Jack in the Box was offering and as a result, refused to apply the deal to the order I would have made."
jackinthebox.com,1,"I went to a Jack in the Box location and purchased a munchie meal.  The signage at the drive through stated that the price was $6 after 9pm.  It was 9:10pm.  I informed the cashier of this at the window, she said that the price was now $8, and they ""hadn't gotten around to changing the sign"" and refused to honor the advertised price.  This is illegal in the state of California, and I attempted to contact the corporate office, but for weeks now my messages have gone unanswered."
jackinthebox.com,1,"Was very hungry April 14, 2022.  Online order at 1195 S Craycroft Rd, Tucson, AZ.  I just setup my app, ordered from the app and drove to pick up my order.  Got home approximately 1.5 miles from Jack in the Box.  Parked in my drive-way, and started eating.  The stuffed jalapeno taste was good, the outside of jalapeno looked terrible.  The tacos ordered were the worse tacos I've ever had, i'm 53.  They were soggy shells, the sides of the taco were smashed against each other.  It was plain sloppy.  The sad part of this incident, it's my 1st time trying Jack In The Box."
jackinthebox.com,2,"Jack in the Box, Hacienda Blvd just north of the 60 fwy.I highly recommend checking your order before you leave the drive thru.  I went to the drive thru this evening, 4/11/2022 and ordered my food.When I drove up to the window I paid for my meal. Before I left I checked my order.  The young lady, whose name on the receipt shows Amanda,  forgot my tacos.  When I informed her about her mistake she told me she did not charge me for it.I became irritated because there are too many mistakes happening at this Jack in the Box, located on Hacienda Blvd just north of the 60 Fwy in Hacienda Heights, CA.She asked me if I still wanted my tacos.  I said yes.  She asked me again if I still wanted to order my tacos.  I said YES again because that was the first item I ordered, pay attention.She then said ""you know what?  I'm not serving you"". She then closed the window on me and walked away.  Luckily there was a gentleman, who I believe may have been the manager, took my order and apologized.I've seen videos of employees at various drive thrus doing this to customers for THEIR mistake.  I believe I met my first ""woke entitled"" person.  God help America if she is our future.  Amanda, if you are reading this, you need to grow up.   You are not meant to serve the public.  Learn from the gentleman who understands ""customer service"".  I Thank the gentleman for his professionalism"
jackinthebox.com,1,"If I could leave a negative score, I would!I have a complaint regarding one of the employees significantly associated with the Las Vegas store, in Whitney, off Boulder Hwy and Russell. I am not sure of his name, because the employee failed to give me a receipt, but he ended up stealing a $20 bill from me early this morning. He seemed to be a light skinned African American gentleman and was very young. He was working the drive thru primarily between 1-130am, on 04/02/2022.This morning the total of my order was $21. I handed the gentleman a $20 bill and asked him to put the $1 and some change on my debit card. Unfortunately, however, he charged my card the entire $21, and pocketed the $20 cash. I did not have enough money in my bank account for the whole amount and am furious about this. I have to now open a report regarding this matter, as this is considered theft. On top of it, he got my order wrong. Something I didn't notice until after I got home.This is extremely frustrating, and WILL NOT be returning to this location again, especially if this is how the employees behave towards their customers. This is not the first time I have had an issue with this store, but always gave it the benefit of the doubt. It's either my orders wrong or something is missing. This was the icing on the cake and has gone too far. I'd suggest not going to this location. There's much more I can say, but I'd rather save it for another time. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."
jackinthebox.com,1,"I didn't want to do this but, I have been calling now for two days and no one will answer the phone. I normally go through the drive through once or twice a week, and yesterday morning, I ordered my usual. When I got to my work desk and took the order out of the bag, I noticed that the container was not very warm. I ordered cheddar french fries. when I took the first bite, I could not believe what I had been served!  The french fries had to be from the night before! They were hard, cold and very disgusting. There is ""No way"" that they could have been from the last twelve hours!!!! I'm so disappointed that this happened and still cannot believe that it did.  Now it's ""Do I ever go back""???????"
jackinthebox.com,1,"DO NOT GO HERE, TERRIBLE!!!!!! I HAVE to give it star because I can't give it no stars. I have been there so many times for so many years and kept giving the so many chances because they are always messing up but the last few times we went (a lot of time between visits), I said that was it. The last time before this time, I complained and got an email from the manager offering me 2 free meals but I declined and just never went back. My husband really wanted breakfast jacks and I told him no but he insisted on giving them ANOTHER chance and it was another BIG MISTAKE. We used the app to place the order because it's normally so much easier and faster with all the other fast food restaurants but not this one. He placed the order, let them know we were on the way around 7:13 and waited in the drive thru to pick it up and all for them to tell us that we had to wait because the bacon was taking awhile to cook. Another worker came and told us that we had to wait because the eggs were taking awhile to cook, I mean really, make up you mind. This is happening while another worker that looks like a manager was out in the front pacing on the phone. No masks, no covid precautions at all, SUPER SCARY! The order came out around 7:40. Get home and the food isn't warm, there's hardly any eggs or bacon on the sandwiches, you know, the two things we were supposed to wait on!!! Go to Whataburger and pay the extra money because you will get great service and great tasting food, trust me, that's where we go because they always screw up here at this crappy Jack in the Box."
jackinthebox.com,1,"At 500 S Illinois St, Belleville IL jack in the box location, this happened to me:I ordered a buttery Jack sandwich, which I didn't eat right away because I was driving. I go to eat my sandwich and there is no bacon or meat on my sandwich,  the only thing I requested extra were sauteed onions. I drove back to have my order fixed and to complain, the manager returns with my order, I ask and I  quote can I  have a  free desert or something with my order because I don't see how you didn't put the burger meat and bacon on my sandwich and I had to drive all the way back here to have it fixed. He says to me he is not authorized to do that, I ask is there no manager on staff tonight? He says he is the manager and goes on that he will not be giving me anything,  at all and that I  was rude, I said I was not rude I simply asked, I continued as he argues over me asking him for his name which he would not provide, he then goes on and says I'm holding up the line, I said that's ok, I'll just call corporate, he tells me back I'm calling them too, I'm calling the police you're holding up the line. I said that’s ok, you don't have to worry about me coming back and yes I'm calling corporate and I proceeded to leave."
jackinthebox.com,1,"I have been trying to call and place and order , but jack in the box doesn't answer the phone. I watched several cars go thru drive thru. I'm sitting at my hotel seeing customer after customer go thru drive thru and I can't order a pick-up. Never come here again, extremely disappointed watching ppl inside ignore you."
jackinthebox.com,5,Jack in the Box is my go to. Very nice and quick service. Above all they keep clean always!
jackinthebox.com,5,"My family an I had lunch @ the JIB store # 8140. The employee that served us was Great!!! His name is Sean. He was very nice to all of us, even joked with my grand kids. He made our visit less stressful. We hope to see him @ that store next time we go in. Your company need's more employee's just like him. Very nice young man!!!!!!!!!!!"
jackinthebox.com,1,They made a fraud transaction from my credit card!I’m currently in an overseas country and I’ve got a notification from my bank says that Jack in the Box company charged $27.46 of my credit card that’s why they blocked my card! Now I have to wait for a new card and I have to find a way to deliver it to where I am now! It’s totally pain in the a**! I ask everyone to stay away from these thieves!
jackinthebox.com,3,ok today I got to jack in the box drive up and they were open. last week Sunday they were closed but there was no sign taped up in drive up . it was only about 330pm .  which I find out today they are close a few weekend like that. so I then continue to order. and I order the fish deluxe sandwich. and diet cokes. which then they say they are out of diet cokes.  :(  .  then I say tea instead. then when I get to the front the cashier tells me sorry I just found out were have run out of fish sandwiches. :(  which I then order something else.  the cashier was very very nice . I'm hoping the next time I go in they have fish sandwiches and diet cokes.
jackinthebox.com,1,I go to this jack in the box 7th street and union hills it is close to my house. Their not busy during this covid 19 so you would think they could get the order right. We love their popcorn chicken and it's a good value and great taste. This time we got crumbs of chicken and we ordered the large . we ask for hot sauce and ranch in which we didn't get. Someone in the kitchen today doesn't like their job much or just don't care. We get home to crumbs of chicken.
jackinthebox.com,1,Stanwood WA location keeps messing up orders vs. what is delivered at both in store and drive thru for no cheese orders fir my lactose intolerant wife.  I am done trying.  No more JITB fir us!
jackinthebox.com,4,"Ain't throwing stones, ain't throwing rocks,Just keeping it real on this review of Jack in the Box,Initially it was going to be a very poor ratingBut honestly after my last visit that score i began debating,Obviously they all improved quite a lot,After giving my initial complaint some serious thought.Gotta give credit where credit is due,It's not all about negativity when uploading a review,Even the food is better,So I'm going to cancel sending JIB executives that dear John letter,And instead congratulate their employees for doing much better!Drive thru and allThese JIB employees on Birch in Calexico are now standing tall!"
jackinthebox.com,4,"The food is not bad, cheap price, good quality"
jackinthebox.com,5,"Maybe not the ""highest quality"" food out there, but the tacos are legendary and the new, remodeled stores are nice. Most are 24/7. Good employees."
jackinthebox.com,3,There's far too much salt in their food and too much sugar in their drinks. Everything else was very good though.

dairyqueen.com,5,U want food fast tast good ?   Well than step up to the big DQ.  It’s the best
dairyqueen.com,1,"I’m honestly really disappointed and pretty pissed.I went with my mom recently, and as soon as we walked in, the place reeked of sweat. It was gross. We tried to push past it and still ordered food, but that was a mistake too—the food was absolutely terrible. I usually come here for a quick bite or a Blizzard as a treat, but after this experience, I’m seriously reconsidering ever coming back to DQ. It’s not worth it anymore."
dairyqueen.com,5,I've been going here since I was a kid and now I take my own kids her! Gotta love this place.
dairyqueen.com,5,I HAVE ATTENDED THE DAIRY QUEEN ON THE BYPASS FOR YEARS AND I WILL SAY IT IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THEY PLAY CHRISTIAN MUSIC AND I LOVE THAT. IT IS JUST A GOOD PLACE TO UNWIND AND ENJOY A MEAL. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THE YEARS. GOD BLESS AND COVER THOSE WHO MADE ME FEEL SAFE AND WELCOMED.
dairyqueen.com,1,I had an issue with a DQ double charging my card and they emailed me saying they sent a gift card.  I said I didn't want it but they still sent the card and it had a $0 balance.  The handling of this whole issue has been absolutely terrible for everyone from the franchise owner to DQ corporate.
dairyqueen.com,2,Dairy Queen Timberlake Rd Lynchburg Va- staff act like you’re bothering them when you walk into the store! Waited more than 5 mins just to be greeted. Had to go back to counter after waiting more than ten mins for food! She threw it across the counter like I was at fault! Terrible customer service!
dairyqueen.com,1,"Purchase on 5/30/2025 at 2:32pm at DQ in Stillwater, MN ( barcode 3970627708030 )I received zero points for this purchase. I scan the barcode an I got a message that I had a purchase within 24 hours, that's correct it was lunch with my wife 23 hours and 52 minutes before this purchase. Should have waited 9 minutes.So what is DQ saying that I shoudn't be eating at DQ a lot?I appreciate a response to this message. I can find other places to eat.Floyd"
dairyqueen.com,5,"Stopped in the Hutto Mayfield Dairy Queen for lunch. Everything was what we expected, Hot food, friendly service, and their standard Coke Machine allowing the customer to choose from a long list of beverage choices. This the only time I get a drink out because I can choosem caffeine free and sugar free."
dairyqueen.com,1,"So the other day, I hadn’t eaten all day—and at 8:00 PM, running on fumes and questionable life choices, I decided to give the nearby Dairy Queen a shot. Big mistake. Huge.I’m not sure if the owner knows, but the wholesome charm this place used to have? Yeah, it packed up and moved across the street to Sheetz, where they still serve food like they actually care.Let’s talk about the sandwich. Cold. I mean, iceberg-level cold. Like it skipped the grill and took a detour through a meat locker. And onions? Oh, I asked for onions. What I got were half a produce aisle. These things were basically whole onion slabs trying out for a leading role in a stir fry. I also asked for extra lettuce—and what I got was something you’d need a microscope to see. I’ve seen more greenery on a dust bunny. At this point, I wasn’t sure if it was garnish or a clerical error.Then came the surprise items in the bag—things I never ordered. No explanation. No apology. Just mystery munchies and confusion.But here’s the real heartbreak: they took chicken off the menu. The best thing they had. Gone. Just... vanished. Like it never existed. You had ONE job, DQ. One juicy, crispy, delicious job—and you gave it up like it was holding you back.Look—I get it. It’s fast food. It’s supposed to be simple. But “simple” shouldn’t mean “sloppy.” People are spending their hard-earned money, especially in times when eating out feels like a luxury. If I’m trusting you with my last meal of the day, the least you can do is serve it hot, right, and with a side of basic courtesy.And just in case the management hasn’t noticed: there’s a Sheetz literally across the street. They smile. They get the order right. Imagine that.DQ, you should be worried. Because the next time I’m hungry, tired, and out of options, Sheetz is looking like a five-star resort.Just saying: people remember who filled their stomachs with care… and who served them frostbitten food, mega-onions, and a lettuce leaf you’d need lab equipment to identify. Ok you have one thing going for you…one older person, hopefully the manager who runs around cleaning up everyone's mess, while everyone else stands looking at her wondering why she has so much energy.  Don’t lose her!"
dairyqueen.com,1,"DQ Buster bars and the Heath Dilly bars have always been  a favorite treat in our household. My question is when did they stop making them with quality ingredients and  not with their soft serve DQ ice cream?! The buster bars were made with a darker, no flavor chocolate and the ice cream tasted like a golden vanilla. The Heath dilly bars were horrible. Very little Heath flavor.  The ice cream again was off, a yellow color and powdery tasting. I have always been able to eat DQ boxed treats and not have stomach issues, but after trying to eat one dilly bar, I was having lactose issues.We will not be purchasing the boxed treats ever again."
dairyqueen.com,1,"Last evening, going through the drive-through the first person who took my one order of one Arnold Palmer was very uninterested in what I wanted, and when I got to the window, I had my hand extended to her with the money in it, and she closed the window and walked away and left me there.. By this time another person came to the window another woman who was rude and told me I was rude and said she wasn’t serving me tho I had my money in hand again still holding it. She closed the window and walked away and would not service me. I go to that location at least five times a week. I know pretty much everyone who’s in there.And was very insulted …and ….how dare any of them act like I owe them anything? What is this a sense of entitlement in Austin, at Dairy Queen of all places?"
dairyqueen.com,1,"Lord have mercy on this establishment! I received a gift card and thought I'd treat myself to dinner! I don't normally eat fast food but thought I'd try my luck at the Dairy Queen on hodgson memorial! The single flame burger was $7.00 and taste like, crap! The burger was, literally thrown together with a pile of hot sauce, no lettuce or flavor.....just sloppy, hot and no flavor! I really hate that I was given a gift card and this was the result! I sent two emails to corporate to ask for my gift card to be reimbursed for the ""mess"" I purchased and heard from, no one! People, do yourself a favor, make your own shakes and grill your own burgers. Dairy Queen has gone from from a 10 to a 1, especially since corporate has not followed up! My birthday dinner of this gift card was a nightmare! I ended up trashing the burger after a few bites and was able to at least eat my greasy onion rings! Oh, I forgot to say, I ordered through the app and still had to wait 25 ins. for the nasty burger! Times are too hard for ""fast food"" to be so trifling! Save your money, people...let Dairy Queen go!!!!! I have. Until someone responds to my post to reimburse, I will tell everyone I see to, stay clear of Dairy Queen until you all get it together! No one, at least, I'm not that desperate to settle for slop!!!!***Update**** I did not hear back from Dairy Queen, regarding any credit or anything. Contacted, corporate to check into this franchise! I feel cheated! Stick with the ice cream! Good luck, public!🤞🏼"
dairyqueen.com,5,"This review is for the Beverly MA Dairy Queen. Always very happy with the service and kindness of the employees at this Dairy Queen. Especially within the last few weeks Isaiah, Karley C. and Olivia. And for you reading this there is nothing sweeter than the love of God for you who sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for your sins and if you believe in him you would not perish but have eternal life.

dairyqueen.com,1,"I went to this place with my kids, excited for the free cone deal that they promote if you have their app—which I did. But of course, things didn’t go as planned. An error popped up, and despite having the app, they refused to honor the deal. Fine, I thought I’d just grab a mini Blizzard instead, but then they told me I needed the app, which was absolutely ridiculous since I already had it. The service here is atrocious—rude, unhelpful, and completely disrespectful. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. Stay far, far away."
dairyqueen.com,1,"Well there's nothing like getting skipped you know when you order your food before the person behind you and they get their food first and when mention something to the staff they straight ignore you, and it smelled in there"

dairyqueen.com,1,"In te past month I’ve ordered three times on line , given the time then still waited 1 whole hour then some. Food was good but might as well close the cave city ky branch. Once when ordered 2 heartier didn’t start my order till I walked in to pick it up."

dairyqueen.com,3,"Service was good, I had ice cream as usual and I always go there with some friends to have some good time. Average."
dairyqueen.com,1,"I went with my daughters to the Dairy Queen on N. Marine Blvd in Jacksonville NC on November 23rd at 1:23pm. When we first walked in there was a weird smell. A group of three customers walked in a few minutes after us and said the same thing. We ordered, got our ice cream then waited 35 minutes for our food while people in the drive thru were getting their orders non stop. I politely asked when my food would be ready and got ignored. After all that time I asked for a refund because I had to be somewhere else in less than 10 minutes and didn’t have time to wait any longer. The girl just looked at me and said “Yea I don’t know what to tell you because I can’t help with that” then “I’m not a manager just a worker so that’s not my problem”. I asked for the manager and got ignored once again. She then walked up to me and threw a bag of onion rings on the counter in front of me while half of my order was still sitting under the heat lamps. She would just stare, repeatedly laugh, and cuss. After about 5 minutes the boy in the back walked up to the register and gave me a refund. I wasn’t the only one with a bad experience. A man that ordered after me waited 15-20 minutes for his food then went to the car and realized they forgot his fries. He came back inside and politely asked just for the side of fries they forgot and the same employee rolled her eyes and asked for the receipt. He let her know it was in his car and he had to be at work in 5 minutes. She grabs a bag, snatches the fries from under the heat lamp, and throws the bag at the man. Overall I am very irritated with how this was handled and will not be returning for a while. Hopefully the situation gets fixed soon."
dairyqueen.com,1,Dairy Queen Paducah ky south side irvinn Cobb drive. This place is a joke. First experience got pulled up for chicken strip and waited 20 minutes for it to be brought out. But they were cold to the touch. So I called them and the manager refused to give his name also called me a lair and then hung up on me. Second experience got biscuits and gravy and found a spider in my food. They refunded my money but it’s still gross. Now I wonder did they throw the gravy away after they found out. Hopefully. Well I wish the health department would go in on them and check things out. Maybe someone should do and undercover check up ya know. But I would rather drive across town to the other one than ever eat at this location again. Idk how they are still open!
dairyqueen.com,1,"Pelham Rd St Catharines OntarioWe stopped at this location at 10:40 pm on a Thursday night (they close at 11:00 pm) and ordered 2 Blizzards at the drive thru.  Pulled around to the pick up window and waited...and waited.  Ten minutes went by and nobody would come to the window.  We could see 2 of the employees inside, joking around and laughing but completely ignoring us.  Banged on the window a few times to get their attention and still nothing so we finally just left. Thank  God they hadn't taken payment yet!  Talk about irresponsible and unprofessional. Won't visit that location again."

dairyqueen.com,3,My problem is we went to Dairy Queen. My friend had a buy one get one small sundae. The girl asks us if we wanted whip cream and nuts but never said it was an extra cost. On the board was shots 50 cents. We were never told that will be extra. I think they should have that in print. We are both senior citizens . Most sundaes give you whip cream and nuts..
dairyqueen.com,2,I love the taste but their ice cream cakes melts so quickly. You can't enjoy it once your reach home.
dairyqueen.com,1,Went to the one in Windsor Green Valley plaza order 2 medium blizzards $10 and some change the worst I have EVER had when she gave them to us the ice cream was melting dripping down the sides NO lid NO napkins really the worst if a kid would be eating this total disaster  never had one so bad went on Aug 11 2024 for son's birthday had to put in freezer so bad for a few hours disappointed
dairyqueen.com,1,The staff are not very friendly. The burger was good but fries were very under cooked and the jalitos were very burned and the tacos were greasy greasy.
dairyqueen.com,1,"Ordered an ultimate cookie blizzard and they were missing an ingredient and so I asked to substitute it for brownies, she said no and that it would be 2 more dollars so I did and there’s no brownie in my blizzard. Fattie wasn’t feeling like doing her job today"

dairyqueen.com,1,"Went to their Shediac spot last week of June with my family.  Broke 1 of my incisers half off on a piece of coconut shell in their chocolate glaze.  Called the manager, was told to pay for the dentistry myself.    She said it was their policy to do nothing and make me pay for it myself - and then send the Dairy Queen the dentist report.   I said that was not fair and I would instead be serving them with court papers to let a judge decide.  This is going to cost at least $1000 for that day off work and the dentistry work, and that is what this Dairy Queen owes me.  The manager reply to that was it was my fault for not having the patience to wait.  What a garbage restaurant.  I definitely DO NOT recommend!"
dairyqueen.com,3,"service was good, i had ice cream as usual and i always go there with some friends to have some good time. Average."

dairyqueen.com,1,"Went to get a banana split and what I got was a banana cut in half and then cut in half again with 2 small piles of ice cream . What's happened dairy queen and why are we getting charged $6.99 for half of a banana split . You are robbing people. Use to be 3 piles of ice cream , lots of toppings and whipped cream . Totally unsatisfied . Will not return to any dairy Queen.Plus the dilly bars are half the size they use to be ."

dairyqueen.com,1,Had a coupon for 1.99 stack burger and 2.99 blizzard. When ordered cashier said it was BOGO. ENDED UP PAYING $17.00 and some change. Nowhere on the coupon did it say BOGO! Wife would not let me complain. Doesn't like to “rock the boat”.
dairyqueen.com,1,"I had the absolute WORST telephone experience with the ""store manager"". She called me names and hung up on me. She refused to give her name but did say she was the manager of the store. I have been a loyal customer of this store for 5 years and was shocked and disgusted by this woman's behavior."
dairyqueen.com,2,"my husband does not want salt on his french fries. most of the DQ's we go to will oblige and serve unsalted fries, but the store in Prairie du Chien, Wi. does not. The drive-up clerk that waited on us got really snarky with my husband and said she couldn't guarantee no salt. ""do you expect us to make a special batch?"" the fries he got were more salt than fries. We won't be back to that store."
dairyqueen.com,1,Spent close to 10 minutes waiting in a drive thru with not 1 car in the lineup; finally gave up and went inside and waited another 5 minutes for someone to finally take our order. This is some of the worst service I have ever experienced and will never ever return to this restaurant. Shame on the owner of this establishment !
dairyqueen.com,1,"If I could rank less than 1 star I would. I was treated awful yesterday the employee was smart talking me and made me feel very uncomfortable. I said over and over please dont put mayo on my burger,not only was mayo on it but the person spit a lougy on my burger. I will never eat there again."
dairyqueen.com,1,"Timid managers who waste your time and never even call for an interview, but they will text your phone from automated spam numbers afterwards just to troll you. Do not support this crooked company, they were not selected as a trustworthy company to work for. Also their food is quite disgusting, glad I haven't eaten there in years."
dairyqueen.com,1,2nd time in a month that they ignore ny request of flavoring when I order an ice cream cake online!!!!
dairyqueen.com,1,Very disappointed. We visited this location and your server gave us a wrong order. We questioned her about it and she became aggressively rude and extremely unprofessional. She refused to get a manager. We asked for a refund. She threw coins at us. We considered calling the police for assault. That employee needs to be fired. We will never visit this location ever again. This was not the first bad experience there but certainly the worst.
dairyqueen.com,2,"Terrible waited 15 min for our 2 meals chicken strip basket 6 piece, double mushroom burger which looked like a child's burger the 2 patties were so small,as well the chicken strips were so tiny an no fries barley for $27 never again. Location was Park Street."

dairyqueen.com,1,"Dairy Queen in Haldimand county Canada Ontario visit.New owners are rude and disrespectful. They have bullied, discriminated, yelled, lie and assaulted the original employees, forcing many to quit and walk. Then they only hire people from their own Caste. They burn incense in the restaurant making the food taste weird since its a strong smell. New Owners don't follow proper cleaning procedures and have looked for cheaper alternatives in almost everything.Don't support these people, they have done a lot of harm to the community!"
dairyqueen.com,1,They offer deals like bonus like double points for a week and when you contact them they brush it off and do nothing. This company is a scam
dairyqueen.com,5,IT WAS SO GOOD AND THERE WAS NO FAT GLASSES MAN BUT SADLY NO QUEENS ONLY DAIRY I ALSO GOT A BLIZZARD
dairyqueen.com,1,"I've been to the DQ in Vicksburg, MS several times. I usually go inside, and the food is good and didn't think too much of the ""grumpy"" service. I just figure it was due to them being understaffed.  But today.... I went through the drive thru and it tested all my patience. I was told to pull forward and someone would bring out my order. I called their number listed multiple times and no one ever answered.  I waited 30 minutes and no food, everyone who came behind me got theirs.  I finally backed up and asked what was going on.  The person was not only rude, but never offered an explanation or apologized.  I'm still mad!  Will never go back!!!"
dairyqueen.com,1,Food was good. The service was awful.! Older lady running the drive-through was very rude… I had ordered an online order and didn’t realize you couldn’t go through the drive-through to pick it up& I had children in the car. I explained that…. I was there right at 11 there was nobody else through the drive-through when I got to the window she continued to explain to me and was very rude about it!
dairyqueen.com,4,"I go to the one on Baldwin Rd. in Pontiac the service is pretty fast, nice people. but to get a nice banana split you'll have to buy 2 in order to enjoy it. it's like getting a 12x12 box with only a watch in it."
dairyqueen.com,1,"came in today, the drive tru. Got a single hamber wih mustard, ketcup and onions . The bun was ice cold, about 6 Ice Cold pickles, and a stone cold burger.  i took in inside  & talked to a lady mgr. she said they had to microwave the burgers. the could not warm the buns on a grill.  THE  WORST BURGER i have ever had.0"
dairyqueen.com,2,In the past Dairy Queen has been good and I noticed the last 2-3 years that I have gone haven’t been as great as before. I keep giving another chance over and over. I finally made up my mind that I am not going there anymore. I haven’t enjoyed the food or ice cream. This last time I ordered chocolate chip cookie dough but there is no chocolate chip just cookie dough. I love chocolate chip or dove chocolates in vanilla ice cream. Nobody seems to have them. Not a fan of cookies n cream.
dairyqueen.com,1,"Issue is with DQ Canada customer service AND specific location: Dairy Queen Grill & Chill325 Central Pkwy W, Mississauga, ONWORST experience of any DQ in every aspect! Two of us walked in and waited in a line where the girl behind the cash seemed clueless with the customers in front of us. There was another girl standing behind another cash register doing nothing, and didn't offer to take any of the customers in front of us.Finally we ordered two dipped cones and a Buster Bar. She brings out these two most pathetic looking dipped cones that were also at best 3/4 dipped. Then she brings out the Buster Bar. We ask her to properly dip the cones, and the other girl that was standing around doing nothing just walks over blank faced with an attituded and goes to the back, while the original cashier tells me they don't accept cash.... what?!? I thus had to take out my debit card to pay, and she was unable to scan a promo code for the $2 Buster Bar in the app. She finally got it to work, so I went to tap my card to pay as she also walked away and disappeared to the back.She comes back with the exact same pathetic cones but at least they were properly dipped, and tells me my payment never went through. I asked her (while still tapping my card) what she'd like me to do since I'm tapping. The other gal now also came to the counter and they start talking in another language to each other... again, what?! How rude is that?! She did something on the computer and it finally went through and zero apology, acknowledgment of the issues, no smiles and not even a thank you or good-bye.We go outside and each take a bite of our dipped cones and they literally both exploded all over us! I'm guessing the entire time trying to redeem the offer and attempting to pay, the ice cream had melted inside the hard shells thus the explosion and the mess all over our clothes. Then I noticed she had given us only ONE napkin for two cones and the Buster Bar, so I had to go back in the store to get more to clean ourselves up.If all of that wasn't enough, I realized on the receipt she charged us $3.99 for EACH kiddie cone dipped PLUS TAX! We had literally got the same cones from another location 2 days prior and they were under $2.39 each plus tax!What's with this lame underportioned and overpriced location with horrible customer service?! We asked to speak to a manager, this girl shows up claiming she was, but refused to give us her name!How UNPROFESSIONAL is that?! This spot is 3 blocks from my home and I'd rather drive 15+ mins farther to NOT get ripped off!! We're NEVER going this location ever again!We contacted DQ HQ NUMEROUS times and it seemed like a young clueless teenager always answers the phone and only takes a message of the issues and promises us someone will call back - they never have!We even went as far as contacting DQ Canada on all their social media platforms to discuss the issues and either they ignore us or.. get this: they blocked us! What corporation ignores and blocks customers that have issues?!?! Never dealing with DQ again!DQ USA HQ needs to step in and replace all Canadian management!"
dairyqueen.com,4,They have different specials for different days. On Wednesdays you can get a blizzard for almost half the price.!! The staff is always friendly in the service is fast but you have to be prepared to wait in line.
dairyqueen.com,3,"The DQ in Caldwell Id apparently is not aware of what an online order is even though they have a sign that says pick up online orders here.  I stand there forever only to have the cashier as well as others ignore me and then take the order from someone behind me.  I stopped her and said I have an online order!  Finally the manager comes over and clearly it's not ready, I don't think they even knew that there was an online order.  What's the point of offering online ordering if it makes no difference?  The cashier was rude, what did she think I was standing under their sign for.  Every single time I come here they forget food, charge you the wrong amount or have a manager, not this one, who tells you they don't make a very simple drink when they have as far back as I can remember.  I did get an apology for that time when I complained to corporate.  Need to have a plan and a person for orders online.  So many problems at this store.  Start with being more aware."

dairyqueen.com,2,"Training is obviously an issue.  We ordered a cone and a blizzard.  The young man made the cone, waited on more people, then made our blizzard along with someone else’s blizzard. In the mean time-the cone is melting.  The cone should be the last thing they make so we can enjoy our dessert together.  Also, there were no napkins in sight.  You can tell a struggling business when they don’t want to spend money on simple convenience items such as napkins.  We only had the 1 little napkin that came with my cone. Sad. Last week your dining room was closed due to staffing issues."
dairyqueen.com,5,Wonderful service. Super clean!
dairyqueen.com,1,DISGUSTING THIRD WORLD CSR. CALLED IN TO COMPLAIN store product was off...at $8  a pop for their blizzard not cheap ice cream.Common sense one 2 minute call in to head office would warrant an apology and a coupon or some reimbursement to have a better experience. Instead these people that you can barely understand send you some dumb e-mail promising someone will be in touch and something sent.3/12 weeks later nothing so you call in again and explain what happened your talking to the same person who demonstrates the competence of a tone deaf Walmart employee
dairyqueen.com,2,"Well, so much for our Root Beer Floats!!!  We went thru the drive-thru which I NEVER do (honestly I don't!)  Did you ever have a root beer float with Dr. Pepper soda?  That's what happened and we didn't notice it until we got home!  This was the Dairy Queen in Murrieta at Cal Oaks.  I should have listened to myself!"

We order a few sandwiches and fries / onion rings with drinks and ice cream. The order wasn’t right and the sandwiches were cold with hard bread. Didn’t realize it till we got home. I can understand why with it being extra hot inside but none of the employees apologized for the inconvenience. I still purchased my sandwich again and requested for it to be made fresh."
dairyqueen.com,1,"Stopped today, 6/25/2023.  Wife got a small soft serve cone ($1.99) and I ordered a small Turtle Pecan Blizzard ($3.69), yet was charged $8.48.  Should have been $6.08 including tax.  Not only did we get ripped off, but my blizzard wasn't what I ordered.  The ""kids"" behind register apparently didn't know what to do, count money or properly make the items ordered; let alone have an adult supervisor any where available.  It appeared all the staff today were very young teens at best.  I feel I am being gererous with a 1 star.  I will start going to Ritters where I know I am appreciated and will not only get what I order, but won't get ripped off either.I would like to add that apparently Dairy Queen doesn't care enough about the customer to even contact them.  Very sad"
dairyqueen.com,1,"I recently went to the Silvis, IL DQ to place an order at the window.I showed my cell phone for reward points and ended up with a destroyed cell phone.Jake at the local DQ has viewed the video and sees that the employee snatched the cell phone out of my hand and carelessly dropped it back into my hand giving me no opportunity to grasp the phone before she let go of it.Unfortunately it seems Jake will offer no more than discipline of the employee and giving me coupons - ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!I now have to replace this cell phone which was perfect before this happened because my job requires I have a cell phone, and I have not got the money to do so.  As it stands right now I am experiencing problems because I have no cell phone at all!I would not need to replace the cell phone had the employee not taken it away from me to begin with and ultimately caused it to drop to the ground and shatter!!!  No part of any of this was my fault!!This employee had no right to take my cell phone at all!!  She NEVER asked for it because given the opportunity I would have said NO.  Jason literally confirmed that the video shows her mouth never moved as she grabbed the cell out of my hand, and she was in the wrong!Do I need to contact an attorney?Lisa"

dairyqueen.com,1,"Dairy Queen4710 US HWY 98 NLakeland, FlWent in on a Thursday at 11:30 AM. There were only two employees. One appeared to be training the other. The trainee was put on the register taking lobby orders. The trainer disappeared into the kitchen. I spent over ten minutes trying to communicate my order to the trainee, she couldn't get it right. She could barely speak English. I finally gave up and shook my head yes and paid her. The food I received was nothing like I ordered. I shook my head in disbelief and walked out the door. That was two years ago and I haven't been back."
dairyqueen.com,2,"I have ordered a blizzard from Dairy Queen for a long time. Recently when I order a blizzard it comes to me melted, either through the drive thru or dine in.The last time I was their service was so slow, I was waiting in line with a friend for 34 minutes. There were three workers and only one was doing her job correctly and efficiently. The manager was also present and when I asked what was taking so long she just looked at me and returned watching the workers. A guy in front of me was there to pick up a door dash order, water and some food. He was there just a long as I was in line. He talked to the manger and asked if he could get the door dash order and the manager, just said they were working on it. After a couple more minutes he asked again, she responded the same and added for him to be patient. He mentioned the fact the two of the workers were hardly working. She rolled her eyes and continued to watch the employees. He scoffed and said you are not a very good manager. She responded saying she was a awesome manger and that he needs to stop talking. She said that the door dash people are rude and they have been having problems with them a lot.I have no clue why Dairy Queen is so slow, but there food is going downhill as well. I ordered the 4 piece chicken basket with gravy. The fries were super soggy and you could see the grease falling off the fries. The gravy container wasn't even half full.The work of there employees lately is extremely terrible and lazy."
dairyqueen.com,1,"A lot of Dairy Queen locations are run by teenagers.Almost every time that I go thru the drive-thru and order hot food and ice creams for my family….I am given the ice creams first and then forced to pull up and wait for the hot food.The problem is that while I am waiting…..I am watching the ice creams melt and drip all over my car seats, steering wheel and myself.Wouldn’t it make more sense to give me the hot food first and then the ice creams or better yet give me my entire order all at the same time?My children really don’t like getting their ice creams…..seeing evidence that their 53 year old father’s tongue was swept all over their cones."

I feel sorry for the manager.I've witnessed some of the staff members just standing around while this older guy(assuming it's the manager)... is scrambling to fill all the orders, the lines atThe drive thru when I've been there have not been super long (compared to other places: El;McDonald's.) But you will be stuck inLine for way longer than it should ever, reasonably take to get your food. I've seen this happen 3 times already in less than 2 months.I'm not trying again. If it's not convenient, it's not worth it, and there are so many better options to choose from."
dairyqueen.com,3,So I take my kids to get ice cream as a treat.  They get thirsty - charged me $1.29 for a cup of water.  Yes I will say that again $1.29 for a cup of water.  Braum's sorry we missed you- I took them around the corner thought this would be easier.  Staff was polite - but $1.29 for a cup of water - come on!  Don't know what I was thinking but I paid for it.  Next time Braum's!

I would like this time to commend Amit, the manager, for DQ White Rock at 152 st, Surrey for having taken the time to call me and provide input. He was very understanding of the situation and I would like to really provide him my appreciation to his call."

dairyqueen.com,1,"We ordered a Peanut Buster Parfait at the DQ located at 1075 - 8th Street North, Kamloops, CA V2B 8R9. I overheard one of the 6 East Indian workers who work there say: ""Do we have any peanuts? Where are the peanuts?"" After a few minutes an East Indian woman came from the back area with a clear plastic bag of peanuts, cut a hole in the bottom of the bag and poured peanuts (and 1/8 cup of salt) in the bottom of my parfait cup. After a few more minutes I received my 'Peanut Buster Parfait' which, apart from the fudge and peanuts, was completely liquid. If you're going to hire people under the Foreign Temporary Workers program, kindly ensure that they are properly trained as my 'Peanut Buster Parfait' was so salty and liquid that it was inedible. I will never go back to that DQ ever again."

dairyqueen.com,1,"Hopewell, VA. DQOn Wednesday ordered an Oreo cookie ice cream cake for my 4 yr old granddaughter's birthday. Was told I had to order 48 hours ahead. No problem, I could pick the cake up on Saturday. I didn't ask for it to have writing on it because she wanted it just like the picture.  On Saturday my husband went to pick up the cake at 3:00 pm . He was told the ice cream freezer broke. They made the cake but it melted overnight. My husband was very upset and told them they could have called us to let us know ASAP so we could make other arrangements! Now, we have no cake for the kids! The girl replied, ""well it didn't have any writing on it"". My hubby responded, it didn't need to !  She suggested we go to colonial heights location as they have them premade.  My husband then called to see if I wanted one of the other cakes they had. There was 1 that said happy mother's day and 1 with happy birthday. I then told him they were lying. If the ice cream freezer broke they wouldn't have other premade cakes in there. They would have melted along with ours and they certainly wouldn't have one that says happy mother's day!"
dairyqueen.com,1,Went to DQ in Jasper Texas. Don’t go. Jasper will burn your food. The girls are not very friendly. The burger was good but fries were very under cooked and the jalitos were very burned and the tacos were greasy greasy.
dairyqueen.com,1,"We went the other night because it was on way home. We ordered qty 2 chicken strip meals with fries , a #5 meal and a bacon cheeseburger meal. I asked for onion rings with the #5. She said total 28.00 and change. We get up there and pay. She gives us our bags and I look in it and there is no #5 with onion rings.  I said “you guys messed order up. We wanted #5 with onion rings” She said “It’s not on receipt”  I handed back the debit card and she gave me receipt and card and asked me to pull forward until it was done. We did so even though we had been in line a while, we’re tired after Xmas shopping and it was raining hard. A few mins later they bring the bag I look in it and now it’s onion rings and fries. No #5 still. So I told the girl and… again she wants me to wait and pay again. I told her just forget it I was tired of waiting. I get home knowing I didn’t get dinner. Pull the kids 4 piece strips out and they both have onion rings. My kids hate onions. So I took them out and half -ed the fries we got second time between them. After all that 3 of the 4 people we wanted dinner for, didn’t get either what they wanted or none at all."

dairyqueen.com,1,"Dundee Dairy Queen is the worst Dairy Queen ever. I worked there and they treated me with such disrespect. I was a manager after the second week we opened and was until yesterday when I quit because of poor management and lying. Also on how when I talk to the owner he treated me with disrespect as well as the son, yelling at me like I am two years old. I went to go return my uniform and just because I quit they threaten to call the cops on me for absolutely no reason when I was just returning my uniform just like every other employee does, me and one other fellow employee. I also was banned from Dairy Queen and their other business that is right next-door when I have done nothing to them. I think it is really crappy and how an owner can treat someone like that after I put my blood sweat and tears into that job working multiple overtime shifts coming in on my day off etc. they leave Dairy Queen to run with 16 year old kids running it. No offense to them but they do not do anything for this company or anything for their employees other than treat them like crap with poor management and lying. The place is going to fall apart because every employee knows that the management is so bad as well as the lying that they are all quitting. I really hope this gets figured out because they should not be running a store if they don’t even know how to run it."

dairyqueen.com,2,"I ordered 1/2 lb. Cheese GrillBurger™ Combo (Burgers & Sandwiches Combos)• Sprite• Fries (Large)Special Instructions: No salt on fries.. No onions, tomatoes, lite lettuce. No ice for drink. Please don't place spoon in blizzard but in the bag.This is my order and the instruction under it is given. I received my food and I had onions on it and tomatoes and the spoon was in the blizzard.Here's the problem. If I or my child was allergic to the foods I instructed not to have on my burger and it is on it and without me looking at it and then myself or my child ate the sandwich it would had caused major health issues to us.The cook need to pay attention to the instructions given when they prepare someone's food or else they could easily cause someone to be hospitalized for allergic reasons.Also never place a spoon in a blizzard when someone's food is being delivered because you place the customers at risk of contamination from possibility of the driver by which the store will be held accountable after finding that it was your business who broke the top cup seal with the spoon.Every delivery order should contain a seal on it including drinks and if it doesn't the store is held accountable to any negligence that the driver does to the food because the restaurant job is to secure all food before giving it to another person other than the customer themselves."

dairyqueen.com,1,"My mother went to this location 3450 W Vienna Rd, Clio, MI 48420 on Fathers day 6/21/20. My daughter had heard me talking about wanting a blizzard but the lines being really long. So she saved her money and asked my mom to take her and get a gift card for me. My mom has hard time walking because shes had both of her knees replaced (40+ years as a nurse). So they drove to this location and walked into the dining area. My mother asked if she could purchase a gift card for fathers day. She was told by the person behind the counted that they were only selling ice cream cakes. If she wanted to to purchase a gift card she would have to wait in the drive through line. My mom asked to speak to the manager because she didn't understand why she couldn't purchase one from the counter. The manager came up front and told my mother that she could only purchase a gift card in the drive through line and that she would have to wait in that line. My mother told my daughter and my daughter got upset. She cried the whole way home because she couldn't purchase a gift card for a fathers day gift. So I hope the employees at this location are happy that they made an 8 year old cry. She even apologized to me for not being able to get a gift card. I told her that she didn't need to apologize and that daddy was no longer interested in over priced ice cream. There aren't enough blizzards in the world that could make up for the fact that your made my daughter cry and feel like she had to apologize to me. I will not frequent this location or any others in the future."

The taste was indescribable bad. Simply inedible! It was heaped with chopped lettuce which was the best part of the sandwich. The bun was good but it was glopped with a ton of flavorless mayonnaise. It was just a mess. I could not eat more than couple of bites and threw the rest in the garbage. It was so bad the garbage threw it back.

Now the french fries...thanks for pouring them out of the freezer bag into my order and serving to me.  Nothing like ice cold fries with no ""ordered"" ketchup.  It's just too simple.  Things that are hard to fail on but you did"
whataburger.com,1,"goodbye whataburger; we like whataburgers, but they have reduced the sizes and not the prices.  Goodbye, we won't be buying anymore!!"
whataburger.com,1,"Always go to the store in Gulfport,MS. I have to go by there after 11pm,after work. I have given the 3 chances to make me and my wife happy.  I was told this evening, March 6,2025,the staff was three employees.3. This location is always backed up,and the food quality is very poor. The ONLY positive I have for this establishment is it is equal to the poor ass service offered everywhere else. Train your staff and teach them how to come to work. Or do a better scheduling according to the “traffic”. We spend approximately $40 here. Will NOT return"
whataburger.com,5,"I recently stoped at the Whataburger in Caldwell Texas. I can honestly say it was a pleasure, the attendant was very pleasurable,informative and the food was hot when delivered. The complete establishment was very clean,including the restroom."
whataburger.com,1,"Ordered the new chicken fajita taco through the drive thru and was sooo disappointed! :( When I arrived home, unwrapped my taco and a chicken breast was in my tortilla; way different looking than the advertisement poster being displayed! I can provide a photo if necessary!"
whataburger.com,2,Probably one of the sorriest meals I've ever eaten. Although the Burger was edible the onion rings were nothing but a greasy flaccid mess! No crispiness to the onion rings at all. It's been $11 and change and it just was not worth it! I will not be going back! This location was in Springfield Tennessee. Just an FYI.
whataburger.com,1,This is the Whataburger on Hewitt Dr. In Waco TX the bathroom smelled bad and were dirty. The handicap parking space are only on front of the door futherest from counter. The door closer has 6 to go pickup spaces right in front of it. So making handicap people walk further is not good. Need some handicap parking in front of both doors.
whataburger.com,1,Speed of service is awful and food was cold even though they advertise fresh food
whataburger.com,1,I went at night time and it was busy. They had a young girl do the cashier. I ordered some stuff and a shake. She came out with the shakes and didn't even put a top on it. She filled it all the way to the top so that when I had to put on the top myself it overflowed. She didn't even smile or was welcoming. I wasn't happy about that
whataburger.com,1,"We  stopped at Whataburger in La Feria, TX. About 1 am Worst Whataburger Coffee, it was luke warm and tasted old. I found allot of coffee grounds at the bottom, I asked for another coffee this time it was too strong It wasn't a Whataburger Coffee it was a WTF! Coffee overcooked  sausage biscuits Never again just a bunch of young employees No Bueno Worst Whataburger RGV La Feria,TX 1/12/25 1:00 am they Suck!"
whataburger.com,1,"This franchise has taken a significant NOSE DIVE since it was sold to a Chicago based BDT Capital Partners. I've eaten at Whataburgers all over Texas. They have gutted the quality and service seems to have followed, no matter where you go. The people don't seem to be excited about serving you any more and act like they wish you hadn't come in. It's a shame to see a 69 year old family owned business being sold out to corporations who just count beans and don't seem to embrace quality. People can't be anything but blatantly aware of it, and appalled!"
whataburger.com,1,"Since I had my dog with me, I decided to use the drive-thru at the Whataburger at 431 Sigman Rd. NW, Conyers, GA. I was here at about 1800. I waited for the car ahead of me to pull forward. It was busy and it was a minute or so for a staff member to ask me what I wanted. I started my order then all the sudden the woman said hold on. I waited TEN FREAKING MINUTES - NOTHING! I blew my car horn. Another car pulled up in the other lane and their order was immediately taken. I saw a staff member delivering an order to the car ahead of me and I yelled if anyone was going to take my order. All I got was a dirty look. That was it! I pulled up and waited until I could exit the lanes. This Whataburger location has taken a nose dive in service since their first opened. The staff is more interested in being on their phones or horsing around. They sit in the booths leaving the small tables for the customers. They would rather socialize with one another than do their jobs. I won't be back. The staff needs to get over their prejudices too. There has been a decided shift that if you're not a person of color the staff doesn't want to serve you. That's how I felt tonight!"
whataburger.com,1,I go there and get two Dr pepper shakes a day I also have my small pet with me which is just like my kid I asked them for a little ice cream in a cup for my little dog some of the employees there will give me ice cream for my little dog I offer to pay for it they said no they do have employees there that is real prejudice about dogs animals or any animal as far as that goes so they refuse to give me a pup cup a little bit of ice cream in a cup for my little dog I will not be doing business there no more and I will put this on social media platforms that is not right
whataburger.com,1,"We have been to this new WAB in Hazel Green, Alabama several times.  The food was excellent and the service good.  However, things have changed.  It seems to be a managerial issue.  We ordered as usual using the App on the phone.  We drove the restaurant 8 miles away hoping the meal would be ready.  We went to the drive-thru and when I told the young lady that we had an online order.  As usual, she said to ""pull around"" and park at t he curb where we usually go.  We sat for 20 minutes and finally a young girl came by (apparently on break) and asked if we had ordered.  I said yes.  She apologized and went in.  Shortly, she returned and asked about our order, taking a photo of my wife's phone display with our order information.  She disappeared.  After we had been there 30 minutes, I walked in to ask for a refund so we could go somewhere to eat.  The manager was coming out and I asked her for the refund.  She said it had to be done on the app.  I have no clue how to do that and gave her the phone.  When she read the order she asked me to wait, walked about 10 feet away and picked our order off the warming tray.  It had obviously been sitting there since we ordered.  The girl that was supposed to get it just looked at me like a  stunned mullet.  She had never made an attempt to find the order.  She had done nothing and left us at the curb.  The manager did not seem to have control and should have at least made an on-the -spot correction on the girl who had not done anything.  She could be re-trained later but that did not happen.  We've noticed that this WAB has gone downhill in the last few weeks and shows that the manager needs to get a firmer grip on the employees."
whataburger.com,1,I just ate my first What a Double Meat sandwich and it was the WORST burger I have ever eaten....It was so bland and had no flavor at ALL!  Then I tried the fries and the same thing!!  My husband said he even questioned if it was meat at all.  It was SO SO bad.  This was 2 sandwiches and one order of fries for $19.  What a bad mistake we made.  Never again!
whataburger.com,1,"I saw that there is a restaurant coming to our area and want to view the menu to see what you have available. I can't even view the menu bc there is not one near me yet?

whataburger.com,1,"Restaurant 1327 179 Village Commons Dr St Augustine, FLThe people at this place are rude, slow and has no business having their doors open. At 9AM I am the only person in the restaurant, no one in the drive thru and it took 15 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich. Since I was the only person in the place, I was standing at the counter waiting for my order and some person bellowed for the back, 'we'll bring your order to you'.  Like I was going to walk back there and make it myself. Really, is that how this works, you make it and bring it to me?!?  So glad I was informed."
whataburger.com,1,Recent experience was awful only one cook no one greeted me and looked at me for 10 minutes before they even took my order this Whataburger is the worst 👎…30 minutes later I received my food my burger was cold and fries hot my bread looks outdated and I noticed both managers touched the trash by pushing it down and never washed their hands 🤮
whataburger.com,1,"Ordered bacon cheeseburger with mayonnaise instead of mustard. Got back to work, had mustard instead of mayonnaise. No bacon or cheese was on the burger. Receipt said bacon cheeseburger, but they didn't pay attention. French fries were bland - no flavor at all. Cashier didn't even have the courtesy to say thank you. There are about 30 other area restaurants in this area I could have gone to. I clearly made the wrong choice with Whataburger. Won't be back."

whataburger.com,2,Me and my family have been a customer of whataburger since  they start but about 3 Months Ago I found out a big difference on flavor  their meat doesn't taste the same and is ticker it taste like soy.Their service is not good  as it use to be and I found out that is a new owner and the new owner reduce labor workers and that is why their service is to slow and bad.Unfortunately  those use to be the only burgers I like I'm going to miss themI'm going to miss their burgers
whataburger.com,1,I have called both customer service and asked for the issue to be escalated.  Each time they promise to call and they never do!!! Now what??  They took my points (around 4k) and they have not returned them.  They also promised to   add 950 pts for any inconvenience and even those points were never issued.  The following detailed complaint has been sent to the Corporate Whataburger office on numerous occasions:CRM:06940044357Hello!!!  I have not received any correspondence since 9/26/24 and I was assured by customer service that the escalations department would contact me!!!!!  Who do I escalate these issues to???  I was at one of your stores this morning and had I been able to use my coupons I would have saved money for me and my family.  Would someone please return my original points balance please!!!  They should never have been removed!!!!  I would like to speak with someone in escalations asap.  Thank you for your consideration.

whataburger.com,1,"I went to the one off Blue Mound Rd off 820 for breakfast. I waited in line for a taqicito and Dr Pepper  for 25 minutes.  Oh and they were out of Dr Peppers. Got to work and they charged me for hash browns that were over cooked and I did not order. That's probably what held up my order. Why do you just assume I want the meal, if I wanted the meal, I would ask for it. What ever it takes to make your bottom line look better.  The car behind me got their order before me. 25 minutes made me late to work, thanks...."
whataburger.com,1,"The whataburger on 66/Dalrock in Rowlett Texas is absolutely the worst place ever…My husband receive a sandwich with a piece of glove in it… he took it back… no apologies, no refund just received a new sandwich which he couldn’t eat by the time he got home he was disgusted and I never took a bite of mine seeing that he had a piece of glove in his…. We called corporate made a complaint and still haven’t received a call back from 7 days ago… later that night my step daughter went to the same location not knowing this had happened earlier to her dad and she ordered a sandwich which was wrong they made a different sandwich again it was wrong… she didn’t check the 3rd time because she was in a hurry… again it was a total different sandwich than she asked for.. they did tell her to come and get a new sandwich the next day.. but this is ridiculous that not one person has reached out to us seeing there was a foreign object in my husband’s sandwichI guess we will be taking the next step since we can’t get a call back.Yes we took pictures"
whataburger.com,1,"the new whataburger on 16th street in orange tx, we made our order, a no  1 with mayo and lettuce only, extra lettuce was requested. plus a no  2, no tomato with mayo instead of mustard. the no. 2 was right, theno. 1 was not even close to what was ordered. both burgers were cold and french fries were cold as well, we asked for some hit fries and never received them. obviously the young lady working the counter was busy flirting with a another male emplyee. this happened at 5;45 pm on 9/8/24, Sunday evening. we will not be going back to this place if business again."
whataburger.com,3,"So what I like is the food the food OK you know that’s good but the drinks like they were like uncarbonated and then we told the lady if we could trade for a milkshake we could pay the difference and she said no we cannot do that so we were confused, but we just asked her refund and they wouldn’t give us a refund so she was giving us attitude and she was like she would be smart about it so she was like no my manager said it’s good. It’s fine. We don’t have the same taste buds now. And we got a milkshake. It wasn’t full. The syrup was all on one side like if you’re gonna make it please make it right."
whataburger.com,1,"I’ve been all over the US and I’ve tried several Whataburger locations. Yes, even before they sold to the Chicago company. The absolute worst fast food restaurant I’ve ever experienced. Always cold, soggy fries, and a dry, bland burger. I’m baffled by their success."
whataburger.com,1,"Meat barely warm ,cold bun   meat tasty greasy ,bun also was stale."
whataburger.com,1,"Whataburger's food is good, what I am really disappointed in is their practice of wanting to keep my change. Each time (well, 90% of the time) I visit the drive through the employees ask me if I want my change. Why wouldn't I want my change. When I asked him what they would with my change, he said, ""Give it to my boss"". Are the supervisors and owners aware of this unscrupulous practice?"
whataburger.com,2,"Visited  store in Colorado Springs @ garden of the Gods.Ordered 2 combo meals, server asked if we wanted cheese I said yes and asked for green chili also.When she told me the price I was shocked  I was expecting to pay a bit extra for the cheese and the chili but not 38.00 for 2 combos. The server explained the increase was due to adding cheese  2.00 per burger and another 1.80 per burger for the speck of diced chili. She did say that she realized it was expensive but said the food was worth the price. I paid ( reluctantly) since the order had already been placed. Sorry to say I was NOT  impressed with food and will never go there again."

What was rang up....One Jalapeno  burger one  jr burger one  small fryTwo large fries , one ice tea, one sprite  $23.00!!! My husband was to nice to make her correct the order . He stated that she told him I'm sorry I just assumed that 2 meals was what you wanted.WTH.extemly disappointed in the service definitely need to train the help better. Now I will be honest and say the food is great, but watch the help. They might assume what you were saying instead of clarifying it. Mrs D Craven"
whataburger.com,2,"I like their food just fine.  When you are allowed to order it. One day they have people taking orders, the next day the speaker is taking orders, they put no signs up either way and it's your guess which it is today. The order box was talking today so when I went to the window, the woman told me I am supposed to wait until it talks and then order. She didn't even offer to take my order.  So I left. For the last time.  This isn't the first bad experience I've had at this location."
whataburger.com,1,"Normally, I don't write bad reviews no matter how horrible the experience.  However, I had to take the time. I went through the drive-thru and order the Chicken sandwich meal. After I received my food, I proceeded to eat my fries first. The fries were hot and seasoned with the perfect ratio of salt. Then, I opened the chicken sandwich and was ready to attack. The initial look of the sandwich looked fine... no issues. When I bit into it, the chicken felt really cold and wiggly. Immediately,  I took an extra look and has to spit everything out. Just as I thought, the chicken was completely raw and uncooked. I returned to the restaurant and spoke with the manager. The manager freaked out and offered to remake my meal. I was so traumatized that I just,asked for a refund. This happened at the Whataburger in Denton @Loop 288."
whataburger.com,3,"Whataburger disappointed me, every other morning I ordered the pancake platter which came with three stacks, sausage hash brown and drink and I order an extra sausage, well I feel cheated because the pancakes use to be really big and fluffy now they are half the size, I will return to waffle House since Whataburger changed upon me"
whataburger.com,1,"Order #108044946  - I ordered from the app inside the store and then let the gal at the front counter know I was there and she gave me my cup and I waited. It had stated on the app my order would be ready in about 5 minutes. I sat there waiting for 15 minutes watchung people come and go and then asked at the counter where my food was when it became apparent I wasn't being served.  I was sitting inside the store the entire time with clear view of the counter from thr moment I placed my order until I went to find a staff member. I was apparently invisible even standing at the counter looking at employees who looked past me or turned around. When someone finally acknowledged me I was told it was already picked up and then that it was almost done. It was sitting there the entire time under a heat lamp. Whrn I got home the burger was soggy and room temperature and the chicken ""wings"" were hard room temperature nuggets of bland breading and more like popcorn. Chicken. I couldn't believe what I paid for this garbage. Tysons frozen popcorn chicken for half thr price would have been better quality and value. I will not go to another whattaburger and tell my friends to save thier money it isn't worth it."

whataburger.com,4,"Been going to Whataburger for a very long time. Started with regular Whataburger, then went down to Whataburger Jr.  Stopped ordering both because was getting heartburn. They now have ""for a limited time"" a Bacon Steakhouse Double at $9.99, plus tax & I've ordered it 3 times. Not once did I get heartburn. Is the meat on steakhouse far better & is that why it costs more? That's okay because I cut it in half & eat twice."
whataburger.com,5,I ate there Sunday and they was busy and doing a great job. I was very impressed they work together so well.The short manager Talks to the crew tells them Good Job You guys to me that's impressive.
whataburger.com,2,"I went through drive through and used my rewards for a cinnamon roll plus I ordered a biscuit. They asked using app, I said yes. When I paid they charged me for my cinnamon roll. I said hey u charged me, she said that your fault I'm new at the window. She left came back and said ur just going to have to have it go back to your app. The thing is I didn't want to pay for it. I was trying it for the first time. She was rude so I told her thanks for letting me know it was my fault you failed to do your job. Frustrating!"

whataburger.com,1,"I waited 35 minutes in drive through for two chicken patties for my dogs. It would have been a lot faster for some to walk but since I can’t walk, I’m captive to your lack of performance. The boy at the window at least said I’m sorry but I’m not looking for apologies but reasonable service. This is on going and definitely needs fixing. There were plenty of workers inside but no one seemed to know or care about the customer"

whataburger.com,4,"Whataburger is amazing. When I think of Texas, I think H-E-B, Rangers Baseball, and Whataburger! First of the Whataburger Motto is 'Cooked when you order' and that couldn't be more true! My usual meal is the Honey Barbeque Chicken Sandwich and Root beer to drink. The Sandwich is so moist and tastes amazing  and I am always given a large drink. Overall review if your Texan you should come here."
whataburger.com,1,"i ordered 25.00 Dollars worth of food and asked for a few ranch drsssing and was told to pay for it.  ive never payed for ranch  and upset that im being charged for sauce.  i also asked for extra mustard and got none.  Please remember that your not the only restaurant in town that makes burgers. you will receive 0 stars from me on your  survey reviews, social media reviews, and online Google search reviews until this is corrected company wide.  everytime i go to visit this location snd order.  no exceptions. 50 cents for a few squirts if sauce its ridiculous."

Despite hearing people from my office talk about the experience they had I decided to give a try since it is literally 1 minute from my office.  I was in line 35 minutes just to get to the window and receive my food and it was cold.  I had a whataburger combo.  Fries cold, burger cold and the sandwich looked old.  The only thing I got for my 10.00 I could enjoy was the coke.  Food had to go into the trash."
whataburger.com,2,went to the new location in sulphur la and it looked like they were short handed but i waited and they were not that busy. the girl working the front looked very new like she needed motr traing . she was nice but needed help . i noticed the people waiting in line had been there a while she was just standing there .finally i told that i was going somewhere else and  i left.
whataburger.com,1,"If I could, I would give Zero Stars!WHATABURGER in La Feria, Tx had a roach in my friends chicken strips! They always put tomatoes in my burger (when I give them a chance & eat a Whataburger) when I specifically tell them I Am ALLERGIC to TOMATOES!!!!My Husband is ALLERGIC to Onions & he tells them so … guess what they always put in the burger?!? ONIONS!!!!We have Boycotted ALL WHATABURGER’s! So have several family members!"
whataburger.com,2,"Whataburger advertised a product as Whatawings, implying they were chicken wings.  Instead, you get their chicken strips, which is a form of false advertising aka deceit to the public.  They're gambling they can get away with false advertising and provide you with one thing, but instead, provide an inferior grade product.  Shame on Whataburger ... not a good way to build good customer rapport."
whataburger.com,1,The service is very good but the food is lacking the burger wasn't cooked it was rare I got it to go when I got home one bite and had to cook the burger and the onion rings weren't cooked long enough and sorry to say ( I will not be back)

I now find myself of visiting IN-N-OUT, Wendy’s & McDonalds instead of my ONCE FIRST LOVE; JUST SAYING!"
whataburger.com,1,The store at WGV Pkwy across from Tocoi HS is the worst place I have ever been to.  They are rude and slow.  They can't be that hard up for help!!!  I will never return
whataburger.com,1,"It first started with trying to order in the app and redeem my bday reward but the app keep crashing so we went in to order. The staff had no clue how to help kept telling me I just couldn't get it. Finally the ""manager on duty"" at 9a.m came to help. He was wasn't rude but certainly made us feel we were wasting his time. He charges for only 1 meal deleted the the other. Anyway we finally got our food to go. The food was disappointing. Chicken was old fried dried out. Biscuits left a funky grease like taste in my mouth and hashbrowns were old. It was only my 3rd time ever eating the brand & 1st time trying breakfast."

whataburger.com,5,Anisha Flowers at the Winchester Rd Huntsville Alabama was amazing. Great service!  Food came out quick and was delicious
whataburger.com,3,"Average or below on appearance and taste of the #1 combo. Hamburger was dry, overcooked, tasteless; fries average. Diet Coke was good! Customer service and speed of service was horrible. They are in no way prepared to do the volume of business in their new location in Little Rock, AR. Waiting 2 hours was ridiculous. Saw 2 people working hard to keep up and five people standing around chatting. Don't waste your time or money."

whataburger.com,4,Im a native Texan and Whataburger has been around forever. Lately the orders are constantly wrong or incomplete. This is very annoying. The lines at the drive through are slow moving BUT I g E them 4 stars because I still love their food. If only they’d get the orders right though.

I didn't get a receipt so I ask for 1. When I looked at receipt I was charged $1.05 for 2 pieces of cheese. On top of that the lettuce smell soured. This was at store 754 in Roanoke ,Texas Will never go there again. I spoke with manager he said he'd fix my order are give back money . I just wrote it off. They teach them to up sell up sell . I have been a customer for 40 years . No more . Also I had to ask Brandon the manager 3 times for his name, what does that tell you."

whataburger.com,1,"This place is going down in quality very fast. It used to be great, but in recent year or two the good quality has been worse and worse with every visit. The restaurants are dirty and unmaintained. Dirty floors, trash, bugs and debris litter the outside. Sad to see this place turning into what it is now."
whataburger.com,1,"So the Whataburger off of McPherson has gone straight down hill. Management is a joke! Served me a burger with a severely burnt bun. Asked the manager on duty if she would eat that. I still have the pictures. Food continues to be served wrong, poor attitudes and here's the new one. Wife asked for a jalapeno ranch and the girl that reluctantly went back to get it. Punctured a hole in it with her nails and still gave it to my wife. I don't know who owns this one needs a wake up call. I've eaten Whataburger from OKC to Temple, TX and I have never ever experienced this poor of customer service, this poor of attitudes and a management so hell bent on not owning a mistake. Till this location is swept clean of it's incompetence, our money goes to Chick-fil-A  and Jersey Mike's. I'll gladly drive the Burleson to eat Whataburger before I go back to that debacle!"

But this morning, while doing all of that,that I just mentioned above, (no help came in till hours later), he said he thought he was going to quit. It's just to hard.

www.hardees.com,1,I went to Hardee’s on Friday night  9/5/25 to get some hot dogs  they said they were out of hot dogs so I didn’t order anything so I went back on Saturday night on 9/6/25 and ordered 4 hot dogs got home in 4 minutes the hot dog buns were very stale and could not be eaten so I called them on Lynnhaven Parkway and asked to speak to a manager. She said she was the manager. I told her that I received four hotdog just a few minutes ago and the buns were really stale. She couldn’t speak English very well but stated what do you mean stale and I said the buns were not fresh they were hard not fresh and could not be eaten￼and she said sorry I’ll tell the cook and that was it …… so I will never eat at that  Hardee’s again and I recommend no one to eat there on Lynnhaven Parkway service not good food worse ￼.
www.hardees.com,1,"One star only because I have to.  AVOID at all costs.  Hardees Niles, Michigan 49120 has become a scam restaurant.  Rude and threatening managers.  Managers that would rather call the police instead of fixing the problem.  AVOID AT ALL COST!  Hardees will rip you off one way or the other and they don't care that they are doing it to you, ""THE CUSTOMER"".  This is not my first experience with bad or missing food from Hardees in Niles, Michigan 49120.  I tried to post a picture of the Frisco sandwich, but the site said I could use a HTTP print screen.  NO BEEF PATTY TO BE FOUND ON THE FRISCO SANDWICH.  I am out $8.00 for a sandwich as well as the sandwich.  Hardees management as well as their General Manager refused to replace or refund but they threatened me with the police."
www.hardees.com,1,"The manager waited on us and was extremely rude.  Will NOT go back. This is the one on 1401 Main St.  First he ignored us, then took our order. When I asked for receipt, (I paid with Credit Card and always get receits), the employee next to him, who he was having a heated discussion in front of us, went to hand us our receipt he grabbed it from his hand and informed me I had to wait until the food came out to get it. He was extremely RUDE. I have a feeling he did not like mixed marriages, I am white, my husband is black. Will not spend money to be treated like that. All tables were dirty even though there were no other customers.  I know why now.  His name on receipt was Kenneth."

I said yes I did and she again told me I did not although she asked me what I wanted to drink when she initially took the order.  So I asked if I could get one and she said it would be $1.50. I said I ordered a meal and not realizing she didn't give me fries that was supposed to come with my meal too! Very bad customer service!

This place closes at 2pm. So I am thinking it is a franchise,  and not corporate.  I ordered my food cause the place looked pretty clean. While I am standing there, I see the first roach crawling across the floor, then 2 more. I stepped on them, and did not say anything. I noticed their were about 7 employees hanging out in the back dancing to whatever music they had going. There was one guy that was cooking, running the register,  taking orders. I got a paper towel, and killed the few roaches on the counter,  and stepped on 2 more on my way out. I tossed the food when I got to work. I figured if it was that bad in in the lobby. Oh well, buyer beware."

The burger was so bad, it tasted overcooked.  One patty was bigger than the other and tasted burnt. The chicken tender wrap, the chicken tender was so small it was the size of your pinky. I felt so disrespected. Food cost too much for this crap. And the fries were so damn salty, when I put it in my mouth it tasted like I was licking damn sand off the beach. The bread tasted better than the burger.  I will NEVER  GO BACK!😡"

I had driven from Concord to Shelby to pick up my nephew from the hospital. We decided to stop at Hardee's on Broadway in Forest City, NC. I was hesitant to stop since my visits to Hardee's has been few since living in Concord due to poor service,cold food and/or not the correct order. Therefore, Hardee's is NOT my choice, but my nephew praised the service and food at the FC location. Glad we stopped and then, traveled on to Ruthfordton to his family!Keep up the great job and hope to get to stop by for breakfast when I am back in Rutherford County.*Side note: My sister and I worked at Hardee's in Spindale, NC in the late 70's.

www.hardees.com,1,"We ate at the Hardee’s in Willmar,MN  on 4/9/25. We got the chicken tender meal. Our chicken was burnt and dry, we got approximately 10 fries, and the bread/toast was smashed and tasted unusual. Had we not been extremely hungry and in a hurry we would have returned it or thrown it out. My husband and I started getting stomach flu symptoms within 20 minutes of eating. I called the general manager and he said he would check the oil. About a half hour later I started feeling super sick. I called the manager again and his response was “I checked the oil and chicken, what else do you want me to do”. I said I spent $15.00 on horrible food and feel I deserve at least a partial refund. He then said, “well I checked the oil and chicken, what else I supposed to do”. Hardee’s just lost a customer who will be giving others my review so I guess more than 1 customer!"
www.hardees.com,1,"Stopped while driving north on I-95 near Walterboro, SC.  (lost receipt or I would have given the exact location) Greeted by a nice man at the counter, and that’s the best thing about the visit.  Ordered a fish sandwich, chicken tenders and an order of fries.  Order came to $21, which I thought was high, but waited for a receipt.  Terribly long wait for food.  When handed the bag, I asked if this was the fish and chicken, to which they said yes.  Got back on the highway and opened the bag to find a chicken sandwich, which was totally inedible, chicken tenders, were ok, but a weird texture, and 3 orders of fries.  No wonder the order was $21.  Thought about calling the restaurant, but after seeing the staff, realized that the they wouldn’t have cared.  Just hoping to save someone else from making the same mistake we did by stopping there.  Won’t be stopping at that chain again."

www.hardees.com,1,"My last three visits to Hardee's in the Salem and Roanoke VA area have yielded very poor food. The Brambleton store gave me rock hard biscuits that must have been hours old. I've never seen anything like this anywhere. You could win a rock fight with those two biscuits.  Didn't notice until after driving away with carryout order.  West Salem and Electric Road stores both served crumbly falling apart biscuits.  It was one thing in the past to have issues now and then when food was so cheap, but now, if they are going to charge top dollar they better serve up top quality.  After the rocks we were served recently we won't be returning to any Hardee's ever. We were once frequent customers but no more."

www.hardees.com,1,"I recently visited Hardee’s and ordered the crispy curls for RS 720, expecting a satisfying portion. However, upon receiving my order at Lucky One, I was taken aback by the small quantity presented in a rather diminutive box. Given the price, I anticipated a more generous serving, and I couldn’t help but question how such a small portion could justify the cost.When I inquired with the staff, they informed me that this is the only serving size available. It’s puzzling that there seems to be a lack of reviews addressing this issue, as it raises concerns about the value offered to customers.I sincerely hope that Hardee’s takes this feedback into account and considers revising their portion sizes and pricing to enhance customer satisfaction."

Finally got through they said the order came in AFTER THEY TOLD ME TO GO HOME.

The burger was not even warm, fries were oil soaked and cold and this was at 2:02 in the afternoon. Worst $11.02 spent. I can except a sloppy burger but waiting for your food and then just as cold as your drink is uncalled for.

When told that a customer put it up and it could cost them some customers that may not care for their candidate of choice the response was “I voted for them so you can go somewhere else.” I guess they don’t care about the customers that didn’t. I’m just one lost customer but there will be many more. Most folks don’t want politics involved in their fast food.

Then when I drove up to the window I was given a cold stare when I requested that again. No smile no thank you no nothing, but they did give me more ice.

It was like wow!!Tommie took our order and she was fast accurate and friendly, Kaleb was great and I dropped the list of names I wrote but on 81/10/2024 if you were working @710 pm every single of of you workers Rick and deserve a pay raise and or promotion. Your shift is the all-time #1 crew. We come here like every week to every other week sometimes 2x a week pending loads and day shift you are good but evening and night shift stole your show. 😜☺️From the cooks, to the front main counter, drive through, ECT the manager , you know trained them to be the absolute best , polite, and to do their job well done the first time around.The lobby is so clean and let me tell you amongst the huge crowd and all the orders the cleaning didn't stop either , not in the lobby or the back. Fantastic and it was all done simultaneously , team effort, team work!!By the way the triple monster cheeseburger, regular cheese burgers, and the hot ham and cheese me and my family agree every bite melts in your mouth. The fries were the freshest and oh so good!! The pie , well that has me ready for Thanksgiving like tomorrow.What a great experience and to think , I almost let myself get upset.

A sit down restaurant for half order of biscuits and gravy with a small tip runs about 20.00. This is what I paid 2 weeks ago. At Hardees I paid for 2 biscuits, gravy and senior coffee only7.38 this morning. Now where do you think I will be going next time around? Great service too. All you seniors on a fixed income go to Hardees on Vine st. You can go in the back way off Central if the barrels are still on Vine st"
www.hardees.com,1,"I can see why your restaurants are shutting down now. I feel sorry for the employees that have to work with the manager at the Guilford College location in Greensboro NC. I’ve been in the restaurant industry for many years & an independent delivery driver for over two years. It must be really difficult to keep the doors open with one customer dining in while I picked up food for one of your customers. I was given a cup for ice, to put in my personal cooler came back inside, still one customer, refilled my cup with ice and started to fill it afterwards with cherry coke. This did not sit well with the manager, insisted I pay for the drink, not the ice. She said, “Hardee’s does not give complimentary drinks to anyone!” I replied, “You guys don’t treat the delivery drivers like somewhat of an employee? You know, let them have a drink?” “No sir!”, she then replied. Man! Y’all are really hurting, might want to shut this location down too?? Scrapping delivery drivers(people who actually help Hardee’s)for soda money??? Makes sense now. Look forward to this one getting shut down too."
www.hardees.com,2,"Placed order at about 9:30a.m.1) ordered 2 chicken biscuits: biscuits and chicken were very dark.  Chicken was tough!2) ordered 2 blueberry biscuits: seemed like biscuits may have been from previous day, quite firm and dry.  Looked and tasted like they use artificial blueberries.  Had a weird taste!Usually we love the chicken biscuits, just not today.Will order them again but not the blueberry biscuits."

www.hardees.com,1,"We ordered two chicken tenders meals. First of all the tenders are so small and thin they should be called mini-tenders. And secondly they were so dry and shriveled up that they were not fit to eat. I actually believe that they had been cooked earlier and then dropped a second time. It was just horrendous. I am one who is pretty tolerant and I rarely return food for any reason. But this was just way beyond even my tolerance level. Food right now is just too expensive(2 meals $25.00) not to get your moneys worth. So I returned the food and had my money refunded. The issue comes down to management on the local store level. If the mgr doesn't care, no one else will. But much of the time it is due to a lack of PROPER training. Also the district supervisor is obviously not doing his job. This particular store is on the busiest road in Kernersville NC., but it is the least busy fast food restaurant on that road. That says a lot about the quality of food and service. And ultimately the buck stops with corporate. It is obvious that your standards have fallen off dramatically, and it is being reflected at the individual store level. I have always enjoyed Hardee's chicken tenders, until today. You have just lost another customer."

www.hardees.com,1,"I went to the Hardee’s in Lake Alfred Florida, I should have known better last time I went the quality of the food was bad. Well I don’t know if the quality of the food is any better because this time I never received my food. It was about 15 minutes before lunch was to begin I placed my order and stood and stood waiting for my food. There were about seven people in the food preparation area all looked lost. Then I heard they were out of biscuits. They had cars in the drive thru waiting for their food. No one was telling people waiting for their food anything finally after standing for fifteen minutes I just walked out. The funny thing is I went to the dollar store was standing in line to pay for my stuff I turned around and started to talk to a Twenty year old girl, told her what had happened she told me that Hardee’s is bad and she tells everyone to avoid it. I did enjoy my nine dollar soda and can tell you this I will never go to that Hardee’s again."

There was 1 person working drive-thru and counter and instead of the drive through person saying, I'll be with you. Nothing was said multiple customers left and she seemed aggravated when you had to ask her anything that you needed. I get being short staffed, but this happens every time.So maybe someone is needed for counter and someone is needed for drive through because not acknowledging the customer while they're waiting, then people are standing there.And of course they're going to get aggradated festus location"

www.hardees.com,1,"At approximately 6:30 pm, on my to Hardees Drive Thru, I ordered a number 5 meal, and a med coke.  I asked for a military discount.  The DT cashier, asked the manager to complete the order.  The manger completed the order and apparently got upset because he mistakenly gave me a wrong discount.  He told me it was $10 even, which is what I thought I paid.  His next words to me was ""this will never happen again"" in a matter of fact tone.  He did not explain what I was charged or paid.  He accused me of raising my voice, which i did not.  I did ask a question to seek clarity because I was confused.  At this point I was more confused by tone he was using regarding an apparent mistake that he made.  I responded ""sir I am not raising my voice""  I am just trying to ask a question.  He responds with ""you want to pay more"".  At this point I still don't know what I paid, just that I received a bigger discount than I should have.  Again just seeking clarity he was upset that I was asking a question.  I left the drive thru confused about what just occurred.  I returned about 5 minutes later to get my receipt so I know what I paid for the meal.  After asking for the receipt, I told him that I never raised my voice and he insisted that I did and said he already called his owner.  Again I said Sir I did not raise my voice and I was was just trying to understand what I paid.  He gave me the receipt and was showing me what I paid.  I acknowledged that I received a discount that was larger than I should have, but said I never raised my voice in the drive thru.  He insisted that I did and that he was not putting up with that.  At that point, I did become upset, if i was mature enough to come back in that in a calm manner to get a receipt, he could at the minimum said something to the effect of sorry if I took your tone the wrong way, no, it was just an insistent that I raised my voice to him.  At that point I did raise my voice and cussed at him because I became very upset.  It is very apparent to me now that this manager, Vernon, was mad at his own mistake and took it out on me.  I would like someone to review the drive thru recording and show me when I raised my voice.  I also want you to view his tone regarding ""this never happening again"".    Please view the recording of both these incidents.  I would like someone to contact me about what my perceived behavior (voice raising) during that encounter.  Also review the customer service of a manager who made a mistake and the way he verbalized that to the customer.  I will apologize for my last reaction, that in my opinion was provoked by a very unprofessional manager.Store Number 150953Richmond 2Order 317555Cashier Vernon"

Paid for it and they held 35 dollars from my card. I looked on my account and it said it would be back on my card in 30 minutes. But that was a lie. Waited until the next day and called the manager at the who was very unprofessional and asked her why my money hasn't been put back on my card. She snapped at me and said it takes seven days to put it back on. The lady's name is Barbara W. The store is on Duval st. In lake city Florida. My order number is 22689087498496. Fix it now please.

I couldn't get out of the driveway when waiting to place order because someone in front and behind.  When I got to the window and paid, received drink and then wated at least 7 minutes. The staff couldn't remember what I ordered.  They looked at the receipt, got cold French fries, soggy from oil, and terrible tasting.  I guess I won't use this facility in Holstein again."

I first noticed a problem when I went to pick up an order and the manager that couldn’t speak any English finally got it translated to me that she knew nothing if a rewards program. Then I went to place an order and used some of my points but could only redeem 1 time and then could not use any more. And finally, I had enough points to get anything in the rewards menu, my phone updated logging me out of all my apps, I logged into Hardee’s and I had nothing no more points. Crap ain’t that bad out there yet. I spent a lot of money to get those points and it was hard and then impossible to use them, and the employees are now all but 1 no habla englise, so you don’t have any idea what your gonna get. I have had the wrong order the last 4 times. The crap is rediculous."

Using the app, I ordered at 1:23 p.m. with a response the order would be ready at 1:35 p.m. I arrived in the drive-thru line at 1:37. Understandable, there were a couple of customers in front of me. They moved along quickly.At the kiosk,I was told that I would have to come inside to get my food. This was at 1:47 p.m. (Hardee's should consult Starbucks because they know how to deliver.) While waiting for my food, four of the six or seven employees were standing around chatting. I ordered fivechicken tenders which turned out to be room-temperature nuggets--yes, there were only five. The French fries were cold and limp. The container of slaw was half-full and the Texas Toast was cold and soggy. I ordered sweet tea but was served Pepsi, requested a replacement which was immediately addressed, it was the only half-a** thing that was addressed. I loved Hardee's burger; however, I shall not return to the store closest to my home, if I ever use Hardee's again. I understand it's difficult to find good people to work but shouldn't a manager do their job? Either the employees do their job or look for other people. I am positive there are immigrants who would love to have a job and do it well.NEVER BELIEVE YOU CAN ORDER A DRIVE-THRU AT HARDEE'S."

I'm usually there going through drive thru once a month for a late dinner.Walking in the restaurant was amazingly clean including the restroom.Reading the breakfast menu for the first time it took a little longer, the selections were many to my suprise.We were greeted at the counter by Molly, the reason I'm writting this review. She asked how She could help us and we began to order. Molly explained to us the potion sizes, the value, even let us know that if we buy one breakfast sandwich the second is only $1.00. Molly's amazing customer service, Her appearance, Her delightful attitude and smile, Her professionalism truly is a representation of your brand. I asked a gentleman behind the counter if he was the manager, as He said yes I pointed out three times that our experience has been wonderful based on our interaction with Molly.I've been in the food service industry with higher education for over 22 years, Molly is truly a blessing to our field, and I told the manager he was very lucky to have Her.My apologies for not getting the managers name, He too was delightful and you could tell He manages His crew with respect and care, every staff member was helping each other.Wonderful experience and thank you all for what you do.My family and I believe  Molly should definitely be recognized for Her customer service skill set, brand knowledge, and professionalism.

www.hardees.com,1,Hardee’s expects you to let customers Disrespect you they can come in in aBad mood but it’s not their fault All They Have To Do Is Lie A manager even lied on Me Why I Will Not Be Disrespectecd
www.hardees.com,1,"Peilion, SC Hardee’s is horrible I’ve been there twice 1st time 30 minute wait on food and didn’t get everything we ordered. 2nd time 40 minute wait and my chicken tenders weren’t cooked all the way and cold fries! When I asked them about them they treated me horrible I’ll never go back there ever!! Nn"
www.hardees.com,1,I went inside so I could get my order right took 26 mins they are very poor service! The food is great the rest not so much
www.hardees.com,1,Apparently hardee's has discontinued the western bacon cheeseburger. That was the only item worth eating on their entire menu. I'll never be back!
www.hardees.com,1,"Went to Hardee's on 9th Ave bought 2 sup chs meals, the worst meal ever hard and dry we couldn't even eat them the drinks were flat and the costumer service was poor. After paying 19.33 and having to sit and wait I expect to have fresh burgers."
www.hardees.com,1,"Came in our local Hardees on college park road in Ladson SC and ordered loaded omelet biscuit.  When I opened my bag, the Two biscuits halves, the sausage chunks, and greasy egg were all just throw in the bag without even being wrapped.  The grease was soaking through the bag as well.  Disgusting!  Why isn't no one ever accountable for this?"
www.hardees.com,5,I really like the friendly service I get at the Madison st. Location. There is an employee named Matthew who is always very friendly and the food is always fresh. And anyone that has worked in that type of industry knows they are probably understaffed compared to most places but he and everyone else there provide good service.
www.hardees.com,1,Hardees shakes are a joke. I ordered a chocolate shake and got a vanilla icecream with a dab of chocolate which makes the so called shake taste like crap. This was the second time i tried and still crappy.
www.hardees.com,1,"I am eating at the Hardee’s on Lucas St., Florence , South Carolina  I have never been to a fast food restaurant that is so slow as it is here to get your order.waited 25 minutes and the people at the drive-through were lined up, waiting. Some people came in and asked for their money back."
www.hardees.com,1,"I go in to Hardee's two or three times a month at this location because it's close to my church, Landmark Church of Christ. I have a doctor's degree in business and I know what cleaning is because I owned stores myself. This toilet has poop on the floor for the second time on the second sunday that I've come in here. I sit down on the other toilet and the whole top slid off and I almost went into the toilet. I am 70 years old and almost messed up my hip again. I have a damaged joint on the right side of my hip. Please do something and get a new management in this store cuz the health department is going to have a real easy time eliminating this unit. The floor is so slippery that I can stand and slide in any direction. Please do something about this store. Fire everybody and hire a good manager and pay him or her well.. if you do not believe me if you hesitate on checking on this message please come in 7:30 on Sunday morning two or three times in a row and see what happens. And check the floor and be very careful or you will slide down. I suspect that you have a mad employee or somebody that had been fired that's coming in todestroy this location.This is a second time that I wrote a review and still nothing's been done.Hardee's is the greatest place to eat but I will not come in this unit if I see this again. I'll have to reroute and go to Atlanta highway Hardee's in Montgomery Alabama because that one is excellent."
www.hardees.com,5,Hardee’s Jesup is the best place in town to eat! From the made from scratch biscuits to the charbroiled thick burgers. Lots of choices to choose from and the hand-breaded chicken tenders are off the chain! Hardee’s Jesup gets my vote! ⬆️
www.hardees.com,1,"Yesterday, I ordered a burger. It tasted like fish and I could not eat it. I tossed it. I reached out to the company and have not heard from them yet. I can not seem to find a survey site that works. What a joke and a mess."
www.hardees.com,2,"Tried to order the ""nuggets"" and apparently, they are off the menu.  Instead of telling me that, they insisted that they have never had ""nuggets"".  I got them two weeks ago.  They refuse to call them nuggets (it has happened a few times at this location) or even offer them when someone asks for nuggets.  You must call them hand breaded chicken tender bites or you wont get them.  No wonder they flopped.    You cant get them unless you call them tender bites!!!  We decided to just get tenders instead, but couldnt because they were ""still frozen"".  We left and wont be back.  Treat your customers with respect and call your tender bites nuggets when they are requested that way.  Geez!"
www.hardees.com,1,I feel like they just make it there thing to mess up people’s food. They’ve managed to mess my food up the past 3 times I’ve went there and suck at resolving the problem.
www.hardees.com,4,Service was fast food was good but every time i go thru the drive thru i can never get any butter. You ask them they act like its in  the bag but its not. This is the Hardees on peach orchard rd in Augusta Georgia. Order butter people this happens every time
www.hardees.com,1,"Hardie's has always been my favorite fast food but in the past few years, quality has gone downhill.  The last straw was today when I went to get an egg biscuit and small diet coke.  The bill came to close to $7.I thought there had been a mistake made and asked about the pricing.  Turns out the small DC was $2.70+I asked about the poster listing a med. soda for $1.25. When I questioned this, the server said she wasn't allowed to mention the cost difference!!!! What the F.....That's it for Hardie's for me and why McD had a line down the street while Hardie's was empty except for me."
www.hardees.com,1,"Real crappy place gives other Hardee's locations a very bad name.Staff management is horrible.The business is ran by children do not trust them they'll spit in your food if you make them mad trying to get your order right.""Mainly the mushroom sauce""Theyre always out of supplies you can never visit without them not having something last time I went there I said you guys might as well close the place down because nothing I wanted was available.Eat at that hell hole at your own risk!!!"
www.hardees.com,1,"Was treated hostile. I believed to be a manager, tall, blonde hair. What i would like to happen is for hardees to let her go and retrain any staff that worked for or with her. I base my opinion on months old reviews and the fact i was just treated the same and she acted as if i had no recourse."
www.hardees.com,2,"This restaurant started to fail after they removed the fish and fried chicken. Best chicken ever and the fish so good, btw, its not only for lent!  My husband and kids always got the chicken and I always had the fish. We haven't been back since these were taken off the menu. Now they have gotten so pricey and cheap with the servings and the quality is terrible. Hardees needs to get their act together and make serious changes or they will not survive much longer."
www.hardees.com,5,Miss Charity S. From Hardee's in Manchester Tennessee Took my order from the drive-thru. She was very helpful and help me pick a food option and fix it my way :-)  great customer service
www.hardees.com,1,"Hardee's in York SC is always lying and refusing to sell food! I went by drive-through last Friday just after 7:30 pm. Lights were all on, but no one would speak on the intercom. Finally, an employee stepped out of the building and shouted at me - ""we are closed because we don't have a cook!!"" I asked when one would be in and why the lights are still on if you are closed. I was told they were in the process of turning off lights. But when I passed by 90 minutes later the lights were still on! This happens repeatedly at the York SC store - but the excuses change. I have been told the cash registers aren't working, or the grill broke. And you can see the employees milling around inside talking and laughing."
www.hardees.com,1,"After placing my order, I stood at the counter for 15 minutes waiting for my food. I saw many cars go thru the drive thru, as I stood in the lobby waiting. I tried to order a milk shake and you would have thought I just asked for her to give up her first born. Needless I asked how much longer this was going to take, and the answer I got was ""I don't know."" I finally just asked for my money back and was met with dirty looks and rude comments from the employees.  I know the place was closing in 45 minutes because it was Christmas eve, but they had not even started on my food.  Never again will I stop at Hardee's in Washington IL. And they think they deserve more money.  For what? Rude and non-existent service."
www.hardees.com,2,Always cold food thru drive thru.always screw up my order. Use to be awesome. Not anymore
www.hardees.com,2,So I dont normally write reviews and if any they are not bad ones but I just had lunch at Hardee’s in waynesville nc and the burger was very sloppy ! Too much of sauce ! Every kind of sauce at that ! The fries were okay and the drink I believe was the best part . Maybe teaching the workers the proper portion of sauce would be best to help fix these kind of problems that can be easily solved. I really wish I could leave a picture but it won’t let me
www.hardees.com,1,It wasn't a good loaded omelet was miss leading. Couldn't find meat or cheese just a little egg . Manger did not give a good response to me asking about it. Worker didn't care. It like take it.
www.hardees.com,1,"Worst food I have ever had was at the Princeton, wv Hardees. The fries were cold and the burgers were cold and dried out. This isn't the 1st time I got bad food there. Will never eat there again."
www.hardees.com,2,"The edges on my Sausage Egg Biscuit were hard, almost crunchy like they were over done or day old bread."
www.hardees.com,1,"I can understand the saying, "" if it's not broke, don't try an fix it "". The fried egg that replaced the folded egg is horrific. WHY did this happen, who are making these decisions? Certainly not the consumer.Sincerely,Unsatisfied customer"
www.hardees.com,1,"We eat breakfast at Hardee's on St. Stephens Rd in Eightmile at least 5 times a week. They are heating the gravy bowls in the microwave! :(  Do they not know what a microwave does to styrofoam ? I had to pick it out of my gravy before I could eat it, I'm sure I didn't find it all because there were2 big pieces out of the top of the bowl and all I found was 3 small pieces :("
www.hardees.com,1,I ordered the breaded chicken breast sandwich combo with sweet tea at the London Blvd location. The chicken breast was rubbery to the point that I couldn't eat it. The fries were meh...stale-like but warm to the touch. The only item that I could consume was the sweet tea... always on point! I spent $9 and some change for a sweet tea. What a waste of my hard-earned money SMH. These food chains need to put as much effort into the service as they do when cashing/spending their check.... IJS
www.hardees.com,1,"I got stomach pain after eating fries that taste so bad and coocked with old oil ,And the burger , what a garbage 🗑"
www.hardees.com,1,Very flummoxed by the total lack of concern by the management for a customer's missing food
www.hardees.com,1,"Waited 10 minutes for order. They claim they lost our order. Paid 4.49 for a super bacon biscuit. Looked worse than a reg bacon egg cheese biscuit. Cheese cold, not melted. Two small pieces of bacon. pathetic!"
www.hardees.com,1,They were smoking and not making the food smoking cigarettes never going again
www.hardees.com,1,"Went in to order and the help is all yelling at each other. Restaurant was really dirty. Tables, drink station,  counter,  floors just grimy and gross.  We thought we will just take it to go. So We tried to place an order and the cashier said ""just so you know,  it's going to be a wait.""  I said "" How long?"" He said ""I have no idea."" I said "" 10 minutes?"" He said "" I have no clue.""  We stood there a minute waiting for him to ask somebody and tell us what we owed.  He just looked at us.  I said ""Nevermind.  Cancel our order.""This is the very worst Hardee's we've ever tried to eat at. Avoid this place.  You're welcome."
www.hardees.com,1,Really bad for a regular or anyone having Hardees to not get mayonaise with or instead of ketchup.
www.hardees.com,1,"I ordered a sandwich with a small fry. When I took my food out of bag, the small fry was a total of 10-12 fries, cold and so tough that I couldn't even chew them. Also, these fries had been cooked for a long time based on the previous statement. Needless to say, I will not be going back to Hardee's anytime soon. It is a shame for restaurant to serve customers with such poor quality."
www.hardees.com,1,I went to Hardee's 6 months ago and said it was terrible would never come back but I just had to give them one more chance and just as bad as it first time how do they stay in business hamburger was either cooked three or four times or way overcooked dried up terrible
www.hardees.com,1,Terrible service at the sunset Ave location. Food was cold and not very good
www.hardees.com,1,The worst fries I ever had. I ordered a loaded fries but I changed it to curly fries coz we loved it. But when I got it its full of sauce and super sour taste  it could be from the halapenos. Taste disgusting. We have to order another meal coz my daughter doesn't like it. Staff not given any receipts.
www.hardees.com,1,"If it was possible, I'd have given them zero rating!I ordered couple of sandwiches from them for dinner at 9 PM. Unfortunately, after waiting 45 mins the food was delivered COLD. I called them to return the order, but they asked me to call them again in half an hour, rather than taking this matter seriously.I wouldn't recommend buying from them, specially at night."
www.hardees.com,1,I waited 20 minutes for my food in Spartanburg South Carolina on Cedar Springs road I got a beautiful bacon egg and cheese biscuit last week this week I got hard overcooked ham a hockey Puck for sausage and dry crumbling bread unacceptable and the manager's very rude and I should not know as a customer that you are short that is not my problem I will never go there again and I will leave a review and tell everyone don't bother It's a waste of money and time and you can't call the corporate or customer service because they don't really care so they make it extremely hard to contact them thank you for nothing.
www.hardees.com,1,"Hardee's was a favorite in the 70's and 80's.  There is one near me and I avoid it like it's the plague.  I have been there a couple times.  Burgers are flavorless.  Orders are always wrong.  Today, I stopped there because they weren't busy during lunch...  I ordered the california double, got the bacon double.  The hamburger patties were oblong and half the size of the bun, flavorless except the over use of liquid smoke on them.  No Salt or pepper on the burger.  I couldn't even finish half the burger before I left.  I will never again order from Hardees."
www.hardees.com,1,"Awful ap - customer service- everything about this restaurant - I ordered- they took money from credit card - 1 hour 20 minutes no food - called ""customer service"" lady put phone down in middle of conversation  - phoned again - no help and eventually I have been told will get money back in 5 to 7 working days - DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE"
www.hardees.com,1,Hi just around 2:30 am onwards i call your customer service hotline to order food i suppose to order kfc unfortunately at that time your agent said no nearby open in my location then he suggest to me that if i can try hardees i said ok im so hungry i literally can eat anything so he took my order he said am going to recieved it in 30 minutes then after few minutes i received a call from hardees ibn batuta said we cant process your order because its not our zone of delivery and it makes me crazy because your agent and those clueless hardees staff in ibn batuta calling me directly that they will cancel my order you know it sounds nuts to me first of all no apologies from the store just directly talking to me that what ever reason they have uncoordinated call center agent misinformation clueless i might order again but please fix your COORDINATION
www.hardees.com,5,"Hardees is the best, I have never been disappointed. My order is always piping hot and all of the employees were friendly. Whenever I go into town it is always my first choice when my family decides to get fast food!"
www.hardees.com,2,I went every morning to get breakfast after work and at first the employees that were working were very nice and food was always hot. Suddenly I didn’t see the regular employees and now there’s a new young guy with long hair taking orders through the drive through that is rude and for the last five times has given me not only an attitude but cold breakfast as well. Lost a regular customer due to awful customer serviceNoblesville do better
sonicdrivein.com,1,Horrible experience today!! 35.00 down the drain. I drive 25 minutes to the nearest Sonic every few months but tonight they dropped the ball with all of our order. I wish I could show the pics I took. The double bacon cheeseburger had no ketchup as ordered and 2 pc of bacon for 9.00My BLT had hard bread 3 pc of bacon and dry a** lettuce and 1 small pc of tomato 7.00!!Our medium fries didn’t even fill the container it came in. Lemonade my husband gets was gross and they gave me a sprite not ocean water….. if I hadn’t drove half way home already I would have went back in and got money back!!!!!!
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The food was terrible …got suppose to be crispy chicken sandwich… looked like had been cooked the week before… not crispy dark brown in color …tough . The sprite tasted like seltzer water.  Have no intentions of ever going back to the Morehead, Kentucky Sonic.  I actually was afraid to eat our food."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"1st The Onion Rings was a big hard black bunch. Burnt!2nd the chicken wrap- lettuce was soggy, chicken was hard. overall cold.3rd the sprite was like water with bubbles.4th I've waited 50 minutes at a pickup stall after mobile ordering from the app.This is absolutely insane.You have another customer walk up and order and have his food and left before I've even got mine. This is the worse service I have ever experienced."
sonicdrivein.com,2,My daughter's food had hair in it and my son's food had too much mayonnaise.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I ordered 2 medium turtle blast shakes. My order was taken at 9:46 P.M. and I didn't receive my shakes until 10:07 all while everyone was in there standing around, laughing,  taking their sweet time. I would understand if it's busy, but I was literally the only person in the drive thru and drive in! This was at the Coweta Oklahoma location."
sonicdrivein.com,2,"1. Two other orders were brought out before ours. Server had to be reminded about our order (I understand it was not her fault? It took under 15 minutes to bring our order2. We placed our order at 3:28 on Aug 18We placed our order for two pretzels & 2 mozzarella sticks we were charged full price for sticks. Per advertisement we should have been charged $1. Not full price!!! Since we were in a hurry, I was not able to dispute.   Extremely disappointed with service"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Placed order on sonic app on July 1, currently it is Aug 14, and still no call back from corporate. I have called 6 times. My order has 3 items incorrectly made. And my tea was supposed to be sweet but got unsweetened. I called store 15 minutes after we picked up. Manager told me they would refund my order. Waited 2 weeks, called back talked to another mgr, told me forest manager lied to me, can’t refund when ordered through app, it’s a 3rd party. Was rude, refused to give me her name and hung up on me. Keep calling customer service number and keep getting told a supervisor will call me back. This is absolutely ridiculous, customer service is horrible!!! I was told by truck stop where this is located that it is a continuous problem with sonic and nothing is usually done about issues."

sonicdrivein.com,1,"It wasn’t even 11:00 and they were closed I got there at 14 mins until 11:pm on NE 23rd and Douglas blvd in Midwest city , I go there almost everyday for the same thing and I sure was disappointed, I had to drive 5 miles out of the way to the one on air depot and was able to order and the girl waiting at the window was just as polite as can be, thank you sonic for have other dependable locations"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The sonic in hialeah gardens blvd.  Too bad I can’t put less than one star, I am very disappointed the service. Hiring irresponsible kids to save a buck makes for horrible service. I am not one to do bad reviews but this one upset me because I can’t believe the manager allows for the employees to do what they want with the phone calls, I went to purchase two Oreo shakes with extra Oreos and adding up the two shakes doesn’t make one whole Oreo cookie so I called to ask for the manager and they just hung up on me then never picked up the phone again I left. Message to Alicia who I’m guessing is the manager let’s see if she returns my calls because I was very well charged for my Oreos and never got them but that’s the least if they would have faced the situation I would maybe have avoided this review the service is more than horrible. SMH!!!🤦🏻‍♀️ 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"This app is useless in my town.  Green chili is an ingredient used pretty much everywhere in New Mexico,  with Sonic included.  But the app only has national ingredients,  no green chili.  So you cannot order green chili on your burger or any other item using the app.  This prevents me from getting any app specials.  It is a simple fix, a special request box, charges may apply."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Overcharge for purchases on your app. App does not recognize what stall you are in when you arrive. App is awful it gives you rewards but you have to keep searching for a location you can use them. WORST APP DESIGN I HAVE YET TO USE
sonicdrivein.com,1,I've gone to sonic for years but the one on Val Vista & Southern has really gone down.  I just got a burger and it was raw and soggy.  Fries didn't have much flavor.  I'm pretty disappointed in the quality the last few times I've gone here.
sonicdrivein.com,5,"They are one of the retailers that deliver to our house through Door dash. Sonic always has great food and I enjoy their fast, friendly, professional service."

sonicdrivein.com,1,"Worse service I EVER got in my life! I went to Sonic in Henrietta off Rt 252 (West Jefferson Rd) in Rochester, and was warned by a customer leaving that they waited 20 mins and just decided to leave. I went to the counter and had no wait, someone took the order for my daughter and myself. We waited 20 mins and watched a few customer come in and get mobile orders. After waiting a full 30 mins, I asked where our food was and showed the receipt to the employee. There were more customers coming in and were waiting at the counter. She took the receipt into the kitchen area without a word and never returned it. 10 full mins later I was given a bag with completely the wrong order in it. The clerk didn't even say anything and went back into the kitchen. We waited nearly 45 mins and got the wrong order while watching others get served...AFTER I paid over $30 for the meals we ordered. I have no receipt to prove the purchase because it was stolen. I will NEVER go to that food chain again!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,I been going to sonic for large cherry lemonades for a long time  and the last 3 times I’ve went they don’t put cherry or limes in our drinks this last time I went I ask the girl at the window if she put cherry and limes in the drinks she said yes  when I got home none of our drinks had NO cherries or limes I’m so disappointed I feel like I deserve my money back I always get  6 drinks
sonicdrivein.com,1,My husband and I got of church and saw your sign for half price shakes so I ordered my husband one of your large peanutbutter shakes when we got to the window to pay he said 6.59 I told him the sign up front says half price he said that ended today well today is not over with and you still have your sign up he stated they haven't had time to take it down and he wouldn't let us have it at half price. I find this to be unfair so another words he would rather throw it away . This was around 8:45 p.m. at the Clanton Al store .
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I work just down the road from a sonic in Albuquerque. Everytime I attempt to stop in for some food, either on the way to work in the morning or during my 30 min lunch break, I wait in the drive through for 30 min on average. I am done with sonic. It's like they have no consideration for the time of their customers. The McDonald's and Wendy's just up the street gets me in and out in 5 minutes. They will get my money and business from now on."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Another Greenville eatery to add to my no go list.  Ordered a #10 with large fries, route 44 diet coke, cheddar peppers and large popcorn chicken and got cold popcorn chicken, cold fries, cold peppers and the route 44 diet coke.  The sandwich was MIA. Called and was told oh you weren't charged for the sandwich....not the point.  I did not get what I ordered, you gave me what you wanted and could not care less....and it was cold!"

sonicdrivein.com,3,"Love going by this restaurant on Buckhead Drive in Statesboro.While all the other restaurants are either closed at 10:00 or are still serving breakfast, I can get hot dogs at that time.Staff has always been exceptional, but sometimes reception from ordering station (drive thru) has sometimes been hit or miss.My only complaint is that this Sonic site does not give out peppermint candy with orders.  What happened to the candy?"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"food poisoning from onion rings May 28, 2025 on St. michaels drive, santa fe nm.  Birds nested in roof pooped all over my windshield (on East side of the bldg)  They didn't even give me a peppermint candy!"

This was after 3 carhops were gathered atound the bathroom door with some sort of drama."
sonicdrivein.com,1,They for got my little sisster
sonicdrivein.com,1,How is this considered a good burger? This company has gone downhill very quickly.  Not to mention the guy running the drive thru put the money we spent in his pocket and not in the register. Very unprofessional.
sonicdrivein.com,1,We sat at the drive through speaker for 10 min. pulled around to the window. 7 people looked at us and just walked away. this is NOT the first time for this happening. the Sonic is in Dover Tn. WILL NO VISIT IT AGAIN.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Slow with taking orders. 15-20 minutes is to long to place a order with 1/2 cars ahead of you!
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Tried to order food , intercom was acting up and was told it would take 10 minutes before I could order. Then the car- hop comes out and accused me of being rude. Then refused to take my order and told me she would call police if I didn't leave fast."
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Took over five minutes to get a response after I pushed order button (two other cars in whole lot). The intercom was impossible--could not understand what staff person was saying; asked her to repeat multiple times. Slot for credit card was dysfunctional; my card 'fell in' hole and I just barely got it out, tearing part of card in process.Milkshake machine broken so could not get what I wanted. Chile cheese burgers had barely a hint of chile. Otherwise ingredients seemed fresh but nothing was wonderful (no 'Yum!' factor). Fries were delicious--all six or eight of them. Really, there were three whole fries and a bunch of stubs.I did ask for 'no mustard' and a side of mayo and rootbeer, no ice. All were delivered as requested. The server said 'Welcome to Sonic' and was polite as the food was presented and server named all the items ordered--all correct, but food took longer than we expected.2 burgers, two drinks, dinky fries = $22.00 Ridiculous.Last visit to Sonic. And I really do mean that.This was our experience this evening.Farmington, NM, San Juan Blvd, 5/11, 9:38 p.m."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Worst restaurant . The food is cold and the taste is not good at all. The service is too slow.
sonicdrivein.com,2,I don't recommend sonic to anyone. They don't have staff that makes the food in a quality manner or quantity is inaccurate. Worst experience.
sonicdrivein.com,1,They have the worst website I have ever used tried to get their smashburger it didn't work both are phones didn't work then they told me they would send me a free cheeseburger because it didn't work Well that didn't happen they don't need our business and our office is right next door
sonicdrivein.com,1,I can't believe my online order was even attempted to full fill. Oviedo store
sonicdrivein.com,5,really Loved the taste of my food. 7/10
sonicdrivein.com,4,"I liked the food, could be better, but it's a thematic restaurant, we can't wait for to much."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"1955 M Mason Rd, Katy Tx.The are very prejudice and do not like to help anyone.They are all white and don’t care to help no one but their race. I am not prejudice. I treat everyone equally. I’m assuming their parents didn’t teach them any manner when they was coming up bad service I gave them a 1 star, but I should give them a 0 star."
sonicdrivein.com,5,Meghan at crossroads location was the best that I had so sweet and professional
sonicdrivein.com,3,"Senior Discount is not offered at this location 6020 FM 2920 and should be. The service was ok, fast and quick. However I requested onions on my sandwich which I didn't get. Otherwise no other concerns. I feel senior discount should be offered just like tips are expected."
sonicdrivein.com,5,"The service was fast and order was perfect. The Sonic was number 5359. Manager is Nicole Roy. Carhop was Josh. From the person that took my order to the carhop, I was treated very respectfully. Employees were very helpful and nice."
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Cold food, melted drink, and super slow service. Sonic ain’t what it used to be. Shocked and disappointed!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Service is slow, food’s always cold, and half the time they mess up the order. Drinks are still good, but not worth the wait. Used to love this place, now it’s just a hassle."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Orders always wrong, food be cold, and don’t even bother with the drinks—melting before they even hand it to you. Service slow as hell, and half the time they got an attitude. Ain’t worth the wait or the money."
sonicdrivein.com,2,The Groovy Fries taste like grease and not good grease.
sonicdrivein.com,1,We went to the 3036 Broad River Rd today and while we were waiting on our food two employees(one seemed to be a manager) starting screaming at each other. The screaming and cussing at each other started in the food prep area and spilled into the eating area. We didn’t feel safe so we got our money back and left. There doesn’t seem to be any manager training in how to diffuse a tense moment with an employee nor was there any empathy for the customers
sonicdrivein.com,1,What kind pickles is that it's terrible even taking them off left taste on chicken so disappointed most terrible pickles I ever tasted
sonicdrivein.com,2,"I love Sonic drinks and I have been to quite a few over the years and sometimes the experiences are bad, some are good, and some are somewhere in between. I have also gotten food from too and it seems a lot of the time it is cold or burnt. My major complaint is the app that works sometimes and others not so much and if you try to contact customer service they treat you like you’re a complete idiot and blow you off.My email address changed and I went to change it on my account and couldn’t. I was told to create a new account which I had no issue with, but it wasn’t that easy. When I created the new account and entered my phone, it told me it was already being used. I contacted customer service and they told me get a new phone number! SERIOUSLY? I love sonic drinks, but I’m not creating a new phone number because they can’t update their systems. RIDICULOUS!"
sonicdrivein.com,2,Every single time I go to Sonic Drive in I order a soft pretzel twist with honey mustard. I am always charged for it but most of the time it's not in the bag.  Today I even asked if it was in the bag and the young lady told me it was. It was not. I'm not going back to the store for a quarter but how hard is it to put in the bag what the customer orders??
sonicdrivein.com,1,The sonic at 1901 russellville rd in Bowling Green ky consistently over cooks food and serves smaller portions than other sonics. They burn the fries and the tots and they are doing this on purpose. Corporate responded with here's a coupon for a free meal when you purchase a meal.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Ordered the new double smash bacon deluxe burger.  It came with a half slice of bacon and was smashed to the point I would need a fork and knife for a burger.  Not sure if the employees understand that the smash is for the patty, not the completed sandwich.  Regardless, there was no bacon and no deluxe fixings.  It was a double patty burger with cheese.  If I wanted that, I would have ordered the quarter pound double cheeseburger for half the price."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Milford Ohio location. Breakfast burrito, tots& coffee $8.19. When they brought it $32. They finally saw they were at the wrong car. Coffee BARELY warm. Requested a hot coffee. I tried to give him the cold coffee, said you can keep that and walked away. What am I going to do with a cup of cold coffee? He couldn’t be snottier!"
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Sonic in Berlin, NJ. This is the second time that drive-thru orders were prioritized over call-in/park orders. It’s getting where it’s just not worth the hassle anymore. Not to mention, they have no clue how to make a thick milkshake.Forgot to mention, they forgot one of our sandwiches and had to be told about it. This, after a long wait for the food."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"My food was cold,French fries  hard as a nail,and to top that off, what pickles are they using? Those are disgusting.This review  is on 12/19/24"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Pulled in for lunch.  Hit the red button and we’re told we would be helped shortly.  Close to five minutes later and three cars moving through DT that arrived after us, still no service or contact.We just left.  No excuse for HORRIBLE service.  Stay clear"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The sonic app sucks monkey a$$$. This review asks for a date, and I just want to let you know that this happens every time I use the app, not just today. I have never, not once, been able locate the Sonic on the map despite typing in the address. The app focuses in on the United States, at least, but insists that there's no Sonic when I'm sitting at the Sonic and typing in that Sonic's address. All of the servers are very sympathetic and promised to talk to their managers, who I am sure can do nothing, so I don't know who to take this to but it's terrible and if it weren't for the pebble ice I would just not go to Sonic at all."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Went to the Sonic in Gulfport, MS. Ordered a small Sonic Blast which was $4.09. They responded back it would be $5.45. I said it shows $4.09 on the order board.  I asked to speak to the manager and she said ""that's how it rung up"". I said that's it, and she said yes. I called Sonic customer service 3 times, and still have not heard anything back. I don't want anything except an explanation of how $4.09 adds up to $5.45. We will not be going back to a Sonic."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"EVERYTHING!!! The smashburger was ordered without sauce, and I specifically asked the girl if they left it off and she said YES. I almost drove away, but something told me to check before I left. THank goodness I did because there was sauce all over it. Then she got mad at me because I had to take it back. This is the 3rd time IN A ROW that I have had a bad experience with SONIC. the other 2 times they didn't even give me a Smashburger - they gave me a regular burger and charged me the extra money for a Smashburger. When I wrote a review - it's been radio silence. Like being ghosted! Because of this...I WILL NO LONGER GO TO SONIC. And, because of that, my husband will no longer eat there. He was with me on one of the trips to your store. And now, my mother-in-law will no longer eat there either. If I get the chance to tell anyone about Sonic or if anyone wants to know where to go to eat...I will definitely let them know NOT to go to Sonic. This could have been rectified...but you chose to ghost me instead."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I have been locked out of my Sonic account for months and have emailed and called their customer service many many times. I am told that my email address is invalid, however, it is valid enough to get emails from them! Each time that I speak to a customer service rep, they are very apologetic and nice, but each time I am told that they will see to it that my complaint is sent to the technology department and it will be corrected. Well, I am still unable to order through my app. Sonic, your loss. I was a regular customer, but your app stinks!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,The food is good but bathrooms suck and take 30 minutes to get the food we ordered French toast sticks and a burger and did not give any syrup on a milk shake we asked for a cherry and they gave us none
sonicdrivein.com,1,I have complained about the app for a long time I leave it I come back it's still just as bad the app is horrible absolutely horrible they'll take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes to get to finally accept payment or at least bring up the payment screen I hate it and in turn I really am starting to hate Sonic I've been going everywhere else and getting my drinks at less prices without all the problems because I'll go to a circle k or somewhere whether even on sale and it saves me the headache the issues and the problems of dealing with a Sonic app I can't express how sickening that is to deal with that Sonic app over and over again that just waste your time I've spent more hours sitting around waiting to get ordering then I ever could have just going and getting the order
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I went to Sonic on Cottage Hill & Hillcrest in Mobile Ala today. I went 3 times in abt a Month & a 1/2. Today I ordered a BLT combo. I waited 10 minutes to place my Order. I waited 1 hr & 30 Minutes,  Still no food. People was going to the Door & asking when their Order would be ready. After the long wait, I left. The last 3 visits was not good at all. The Lady said the Ice Cream Machine has been broke for 2 months.  That's ridiculous.  Not good Service at all! I won't be back there!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,I used the Sonic app for chicken bites and a large banana shake. I got there 3 min later than the app said it would be ready. There are only 2 cars in the lot. It took another 12 min to get the order. The sauces that I requested are on the receipt but not in the bag. The banana shahe was requested with NO cherries yet they were in side the shake. I didn't taste banana until I got to the bottom and it is not real banana. It use to be better a long time ago
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Well, between their constantly interrupting us when trying to order, they got 2 of our 3 orders WRONG AGAIN. Will not be going back to the 10969 N 83rd Ave in Peoria. Every time we go there they get it wrong and we don't feel like going back to return the food after a long day at work. Don't put people taking orders who DON'T LISTEN, making the customer constantly have to repeat ourselves!! Also was overcharged because we ordered doubles and got singles. What a terrible experience"
sonicdrivein.com,3,"Sonic in Henderson, Nevada has always been my go to for their American Graffiti style service. And I love their limeaid drink. Fast forward to 2024, being able to order online and to choose delivery or pickup is a plus. The problem with this is the cook(s) are not reading the order receipts correctly. Order 1 placed in October (delivered) did not include my request for no cheese on my burger and no requested whipped cream on the Sonic blast. Order 2 placed in November (pick up) did not include my request for whipped cream on my Sonic blast, and they also did not include mayonnaise on my sandwich as this was a “come with” for this chicken sandwich. Also, I requested extra lime which was not added. Both these could have been excellent orders if the order receipt was read. So making change requests to customize an order doesn’t make since if your order is constantly incorrect. Plus, extras added cost extra, too. So I’m paying for extras I’m not getting. Not a very good way to run a business. And trying to call the restaurant to let them know your order was wrong doesn’t help especially if you had your order delivered because they pass the customer off on the delivery service and the delivery service passes you back to the restaurant. That’s bad customer service!"
sonicdrivein.com,3,"Someone must teach these people how to cook a french fry. If they turn the temperature up or let them to where they were crispy would be divine. I go to Sonic 4–5 times a week, mostly for drinks, I have ordered the new groovy fries four times and they are so soggy, they are limp, there was no crispiness and they tasted like sonic grease. I am so disappointed."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"My experience at Sonic was, pitiful. We ordered four drinks, a hot dog, and some fries. We got our first order at a fair time of about 12 minutes; however, we did not receive one of the drinks we had paid for—which was a Reece’s shake.We pulled back into the bay to ask about it, and waited from roughly 6:50pm to 7:14pm. We did not receive our, singular, shake, and no one came out to our bay. At this point, we pulled to the drive thru to make sure we got service. The line moved extremely slowly, the technology was glitchy, not showing us our totals, not picking up audio, not showing us who took our order or if it was even taken, and to top it all off, we weren’t the only people who received this service.There was a car next to us who waited 20 minutes for two drinks, a car to the right of that who didn’t receive their order and eventually left, and the car in front of us at the drive thru didn’t get a burger they ordered.I know working at a restaurant of any kind isn’t easy, but this was ridiculous. If it takes a few minutes to make the food it’s one thing, but this many errors in orders across such a short time is surprising and either a result of poor management, or employees.Overall, I cannot recommend Sonic. They have good slushies and shakes, but their actual ability to make your order correctly, or quickly, is pathetic.This review was about a Sonic in Hendersonville, NC."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Was on lunch  break had to wait for 20 mins before  even helping .and I'm standing out side in the cold because  you can't order inside also didn't give me fries like I ordered  gave me tots ....they seem more concerned  with there drive thru then there outside customers  ....horrible  experience....
sonicdrivein.com,1,"At the Sonic on Hwy 3 in Dickinson Texas your employees were rude to me. They have had issues in the past with their speakers and kept interrupting my order with ""Is that all?"" so I spoke louder. The manager even slammed window shut in my face and said in an angry, strident voice"" HAVE A GREAT DAY"" which sounded to me like "" go to hell"". I go to Sonic every day but will never go to that one again. Did they even ever get customer service training? They are lacking it!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,This bad far the slowest location ever in Irving off beltline
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I ordered a medium oreo blast.  When I got it they just topped it with a few oreo cookies instead of mixing and blending it into the entire desert.  So basically I was just eating ice cream down to the bottom.  I will NEVER EVER return to Sonic again.  This happend at 3648 N maize Rd.  Maize, Ks.Besides this their people always have nose pearling and long hair.  I probably got hair in my desert as well.  Never will ho to a Sonic again until I'm promised that you change your policies."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I try to use a coupon for a drink and they said no. yes i want my cherry limeade, no i don’t want to leave empty handed. what happened? I left empty handed."
sonicdrivein.com,1,I've tried to get. Ice at the lake worth sonic for the last month. They tell me every time they have no ice The manager was very rude to me this morning. Do not appreciate that. Never had  that problem when they had the old manager.
sonicdrivein.com,1,The lady in service at night by 22:54 pm came to me and let fall down everything in my car and left. I tried to talk to her but she did not take care. I'm a doordash driver. She always do same thing all the times
sonicdrivein.com,1,Nasty… They serve old food and the service is horrible. Trash can overflowing outside just disgusting 🤮Closed this Sonic (Latham) or hire new workersMilkshake’s on point…
sonicdrivein.com,1,CHAMPAIGN NORTH MATTIS IS TERRIBLE!!After attempting to order 2 basic combos and repeating them 5 times to him and him repeating back the wrong items every time he gave up and told us to pull around for the total. Once there we asked to have the order repeated to us. The lady working the window was clearly irritated that we even asked and sighed and then read the order back which was not even close to what we ordered. We were the only ones in the drive-thru….i said that’s not what we ordered and her response was “that’s what y’all ordered. We left and will never be back!!! Stay away from that location or you’ll have to deal with the lazy and careless employees that work there!! 00000-STARS
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Well, I decided to order on the Sonic app for the 1st time specifically to take advantage of their on line discounts. We ordered the double cheeseburgers, asked for extra onions. Placed the order and followed their protocol. Arrived on time and did the check in as directed on the app. After about 10 minutes my order popped up on the screen stating that the order was being cooked. Then, the person who brings the food out approaches me with the shake that was part of the order and tells me sorry your order was misplaced,  but here's your shake and they are making your order now. Approximately 20 minutes after my initial arrival, I received my food.  Got home and none of the burgers had extra onions and were drowned in mustard. I will never use their app again and will think twice about eating Sonic again. It's not like they have the best burgers or prices anyway."
sonicdrivein.com,1,I ordered a smash burger and I read the info on what it was supposed to be. I got my smash burger and it was NOTHING like the picture!!!! No resemblance!!I use to love Sonic burgers but they have changed their beef Pattie’s and they taste awful!  That why I thought a smash burger might just be what I wanted. I was disappointed. Just another reason NOT to buy anymore Sonic burgers!!!!!
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I live in Richmond Virginia, I don't eat out much anymore because of this type of foolishness going on. I sent an advertisement with the Sonic smashburger and it looks so delicious I just had to try it. So I ordered the sandwich only because I don't eat out much and I didn't want the fries or a soda. So I went around to pay for my order and the guy he was nice. The sandwich came to around $7 and some change. I pay for my sandwich and I was just waiting for him to give it to me when it come up. So as I was waiting he wasn't busy so I asked him for a cup of water, he said ""I will have to charge you for water"", I said to myself huh! So then I said excuse me I just ordered a sandwich,,, I can't get any water? He then said he was sorry that he will have to charge me for the water. I asked for a manager. She came to the window,,, I explained to her I ordered a sandwich and I just wanted some water and she looked at me and she said I will have to charge you for that. I said really! I said I just want water to wash it down as I'm eating it she said again no I will have to charge you. So I asked for my money back and she really looked at me  like I was crazy or something. After she gave me my money back I then told her,,, y'all are going to lose a lot of business and money. I left,,, in a state of shock or something like that. I still am ""Sonic"",,, acting like that now!!!This particular Sonic is on route 1 Chesterfield Virginia. Route 1 used to be Jefferson Davis highway,,,"
sonicdrivein.com,1,Ordered a chicken sandwich had very little lettuce on itOrderedfries with queso could not even see the queso on the friesEverytime we go it gets worse
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I went to the Sonic at 3838 Parker Road in Wylie, Tx.  They were not busy, about 7 cars.  I order two Sonic Burgers only, no fries or drinks.  After waiting about 15 minutes I was getting very frustrated and then a message comes up on the screen that says Abraham is on the way with my order.  I wait another 5 minutes and still no order so I push the button and ask where is my order.  A person answers and says he is the only car hop and is trying to get the orders delivered.  He tells me how busy they are which was a smoke screen, like I said there only about seven cars there.  A couple minutes later a car hop, Abraham I assume, walks by my car with two drinks in his hand for delivery to another car.  Now I am beyond frustrated so I get out  of my car, walk to the building and tell them I want a credit for my order.  He asks me what I ordered and I told him two Sonic Burgers.  A young girl standing at the counter hands him a sack with my order.  The burgers were already cold and it is my guess they had been sitting on the counter for quite some time.  There were four people working inside and one delivering orders.  Unbelievable.  I am done with Sonic."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The REALLY bad customer service is bad enough, but their gift card scam is THE WORST!!(1)  If there isn't enough on a gift card to use for an order, you can't use it at all;(2) You can't use what's left on the card and combine it with a debit/credit card to make up the difference and finish the order;(3) You can't combine gift cards to use up the small amounts left on them for a single order;(4) You're given the option to add money to the gift card to make it enough for the purchase... BUT then the system will experience ""technical difficulties"" so that you can't use the money you JUST put on the card!(5) Calling their regular helpline does you no good.  You have to call 877-828-7868 to angrily demand a refund on the gift card.It's closed now, but I'll be calling first thing in the morning to get ALL the money back that I put on the card.I AM SOOO DONE WITH SONIC'S THEFT!!Addendum:  Called the 877 number 09-12-24.  Told they don't refund gift cards and I have to call the main number, which is where I got the 877 number from because THEY don't refund gift cards, either.  SCAM!!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,lady at window was extremely rude. food was made wrong and thrown together. had onions even after telling them i am allergic. burger was broke in half. bun is stale.
sonicdrivein.com,1,This is the 3rd time I have ordered food at Sonic.  Only for it to be ice cold as soon as they handed it to me.  The cheese on the tator tots wasn't even melted.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Disgusted  the food is awful they don't care about customer service they serve whatever it takes horrible it looks horrible it buys no one to eat at any Sonic drive in ever
sonicdrivein.com,1,This is my first time visiting this location and I had horrible experience. I waited 15 minutes for my order to receive cold food and the only thing I was satisfied with was the drink. After I receive my order I left a tip. I will not visit this location every in life again.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Customer service... took 15-20 minutes just to get change back, that's equal to the time it took waiting for ""fresh"" food. Absolutely disgusting restrooms with massive, smelly, puddles of yellow liquid just pooled into the center of the floor, stagnant for who knows how long. Not to mention the trash is so far from the door, after washing up you have to grab the handle without a paper towel, what's the point of washing my hands if I have to touch your filthy door afterwords? Put the trash next to the exit so we can use the paper towels to leave the restroom. As far as food goes, not good. Burgers literally just taste like patty with slimy lettuce strips that are impossible to chew, cheese fries nice and room temperature, just the way nobody likes."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The last time I went to Sonic the burger was smaller and drier, so I have not gone back until today when I decided to give it another shot. I ordered a #1 and tator tots with chili and cheese and it was delivered very promptly. My first bite in it was completely apparent they are not using the same meat they used to. It tasted of the cheapest bi-product patty that I have ever had. In fact, it tasted as if the frozen patty had been thawed before putting on the burner. The tator tots with cheese tasted as if it was ordered by someone else and left on the burner because they were hard ad chewy on the outside. It looked as if they put one dab of cheese and chili onto my tots even though there is an extra charge. I worked at a Sonic when I was 15 and worked my school years there and never lost the desire to eat Sonic. I am not sure what has happened to this place: Maybe sourcing the cheapest ingredients or corporate greed but it is a shame that a longtime patron refuses to waste their money on this awful product."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"You can tell it was sold.  Not worth going there anymore.  Burgers are smaller, deals are terrible. The 1.99 burger reminds me of a white castle size burger.  I use to go at five times a week now, once every two months .  But won be going back ."
sonicdrivein.com,3,Live in Oklahoma and i am starting to not like Sonic . The burgers used to be great and a Super Sonic was one of the best but as years have gone by quality of food has dropped (Slogan used to be we don't start cooking till you get here) and the flavor of the burgers has gone away . But more to the point here is the pricing . Our Sonic has a Braums right next door to it . My wife and i go to sonic to get a medium Oreo Blast(my favorite) and a Hot fudge sundae . Total is almost 10 dollars yet if we to Braums for single dip sundae and what ever i get(changes everytime i go) the total is around 6 bucks. Sonic has much lower operating costs i am sure why are prices so high. Sonic you need to rethink your pricing or go back to the great quality you used to have . As for me i am done with Sonic .
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I'm copying a local response. I won't be back.nor anyone I can convince.When I tell you me and little g just had the wildest sonic experience ever!!!!  I mean like I’m still confused by what happened.Marli was at soccer so we swing by sonic to get what I thought would be an innocent transaction and some slushies. Well I was unpleasantly shocked when I wait at the drive through speaker 6 minutes patiently and no one answered. So I drove to the window to order bc I assumed they didn’t know I was there.Well at the window a young (maybe 18, MAYBE) and her older male associate both see me. Look at me and look away and continue to take the order behind me.  So I said hello?  And they rolled throw eyes again.   I turned to tell g I didn’t have time to keep waiting we had to leave  (14 minutes without even speaking to anyone at this point ).  I start to drive off and that girl HUNG OUT THE WINDOW OF THE DRIVE THROUGH TO SCREAM AND CALL ME A STUPID B****. So I stopped and turned around out my window to say “excuse me!?” And she proceeds to call me all the names.   I’m just trying to get a slushy for my kid!I pull up and call into the store and ask if management is present in that store today.  The guy who rolled his eyes tells me he is the manager and he absolutely condones her behavior bc I said something smart before leaving and I am in fact a B****. When I tell you I was baffled bc I had literally not said anything to them I mean it.  The smart comment in question was me telling Garrett we had to leave …… me and g are both confused and this girl is telling me to come get some bc apparently she wants to fight in the drive through 🤦🏻‍♀️So needless to say that’s the last adventure we have there.  And will be getting slushies anywhere else.   The amount of childishness is unreal!   And unmatched.    Good grief stay away from that establishment. WILD BEHAVIORS.  WILD."
sonicdrivein.com,5,Everyone was helpful and cheerful and understandable..they spoke clearly.  Food was piping hot and delicious!  I got a steak sandwich combo and a smasher sandwich.  Equally good!  My experience was very gratifying.  Keep up the good work!  This was at the sonic on north woodlawn in wichita.
sonicdrivein.com,1,guy at pick up window not very friendly then get food asked for ranch dipping sauce never got it food not that good
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I went to the Sonic in Tulsa Oklahoma, store 4765. On Aug 8,2024 at 6:10 pm. First, the location is run down. Held the stalls don’t have any way to order, all the signs and everything taken out of the stall. I ordered a smash burger with no cheese.  My receipt even stars no cheese. However, the burger still had cheese.  Also, homeless people where digging through the trash on the patio.  Come on. Do better for you paying customers or go ahead and close the location. Closing it down will keep the owner from slowly dragging the the outcome anyway.  Just close it or make it better for customers."
sonicdrivein.com,3,"My wife and I recently tried the new Sonic Smasher, since we just moved to this neighborhood, and there's a Sonic nearby. We used to live in a major metro near a hamburger chain that is well known for its ""smashed"" burgers. The Sonic burger tasted good, but it was not at all crispy. It was a regular burger in taste and texture. Although it wasn't bad, it is not worth a return visit. It's hard to know if the local grill crew were properly trained.On the other hand, the extra queso we ordered for the tots was particularly vile. It had a chemical taste we found unpleasant. I didn't even offer it to the dog."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Stale hotdog buns - again! I thought it was a fluke, but apparently, they don't mind serving rock-hard, stale buns, which completely ruined the dog."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"We use to go to the sonic in Belaire Ks almost every single day but it seemed we were always having issues do we quit going as much. This last weekend I decided I really would like some ice cream and decided to give them another chance since its is so close. After reading the description I ordered a turtle praline nut blaster, the picture showed it had the nuts and chocolate truffles mixed through out but all it had was some of the nuts and chocolate truffles sparsely sprinkled on the top and nuts were really hard with a bit of old taste. So i paid almost five dollars for a cup of soft serve ice cream that i couldn't eat. The service and food is awful and makes me really sad as it use to be my go to for fast food."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Sonic: Military Pkwy, Mesquite TX, near I-635.Please, Sonic leaders, hierarchy, do something. Turnover is a huge problem, employees are often in training which increases error rates. No register to use, on the off-chance one pays with cash. The cashiers literally use a small cup for dollar bills. if change is needed, they avoid the topic hoping it will go unmentioned. If you request your 85 cents, a frown is met as they dig into pockets to unite and gather 85 cents. Very Serious! Honestly, the leaders should be responsible for ill-equipped employees on the front line and targeted. Long wait times, cold food and, incorrect orders filled. The cherry limeade, has neither cherries or limes. DO SOMETHING!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Lived in Azle 4 years... Have been here maybe 4 times, thinking it may be better this time. Nope!! Last time made my chili cheese dog incorrect, sent it back and came wrong the second time. This time no spoons? What!? Ridiculous. Not coming back. Period."
sonicdrivein.com,5,I have no idea how to order but thenDenise from store location  6442 helps ne alot.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Went to the Middletown Ohio sonic and ordered a sonic blast. That was almost $7.00. And I ordered an Oreo blast and it had two small Oreo pieces on top and no other Oreos in the whole cup.  It was all vanilla ice cream. Totally ridiculous! They are terrible.
sonicdrivein.com,2,It would be nice if they would fresh cook their patties. Cooked in the morning and served cold.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Everyone at sonic is always rude. They all seem to be new also bc they never know what’s going. My orders are constantly wrong. The app is the absolute worst. If there’s not enough on a gift card it tells you to reload it but it never goes through! It should take off the amount on the card and let you pay the rest with a credit/debit card. It sometimes won’t even accept gift cards when trying to add them to my account (yes I’m positive there’s money on them). Many times iv tried to place an order but it says it can’t be completed. The workers never are helpful when this happens. Once you put the gift card in the app you can’t use it at the store so I can’t just go there and place the order in person.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Among other items, we ordered ""Groovy Fries"" which are $1.00 for a large, for a limited time. The fries were awful, very greasy (downright oily) and all were tiny bits for which there was no way to dip them. The large ??? size was laughable, equal to anyone else's medium fry at best. It appears as though Sonic will be charging $3.49 for these fries once the promotion is over. GOOD LUCK with that. I hope the old style fries will still be available."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Sonic in Midland dr in Midland Tx is absolutely horrible. I would leave 0 stars is possible.  Manger walks in the out door and runs into an employee.  Took 18 min to make (1) med blast. Several cars got their larger orders served before who drove up and ordered after me with trays of food.  The stupid girl who took my order on del it should not be dealing with public and I’ll leave it at that.  Never again.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I know a person who worked for Sonic and was fired because of two workers mistakes and one being a manager, while she was terminated the manager allowed a pervert to work there! This is the Sonic on shorter ave in rome ga, the manager told the worker she didn’t want the news about the pedo getting to Hr! There has been many warnings given to this man he sexually harassed and tried to sexually assault the worker and others! THIS WILL BE ON THE NEWS SOON COOSA VALLEY! Look out for the name Malachi Johnson."
sonicdrivein.com,1,OMG! What idiot at sonic thought it was a good idea to change the french fries! The new fries suck! Will not be going back to Sonic ever!
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Honest: They already had my hamburgers cooked. They threw them back on the grill. The first one was not as good as usual, the second one was completely uneatable.I buy Sonics in different locations. This one by far has the worse cook."
sonicdrivein.com,1,the ice cream machine was down and made the hot dogs  wrong   the manager was very rude and said they were on a 15 min hold for food and she said  if people leave she doesn't care  i have been in customer service are well over 15 years you dont treat you customers like that and contracting support was no help   they want to give me gift card and free  food  i dont what to eat there at all
sonicdrivein.com,1,"FIX YOUR STUPID APP, I WAS PARKED AT SONIC AND PLACE ORDER AT A DIFFERENT SONIC ACROSS TOWN NOT KNOWING THE ADDRESS! THE APP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CURRENT LOCATION!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Restaurant sat on my delivery order for 45 minutes before cancelling it.  It was already 15 minutes late when they cancelled.  TWO drivers went to pick it up from the restaurant... after that, they cancelled the order saying it was not deliverable.  We are around the corner from them.  Poor service... actually no service lol.  Will not be ordering from Sonic again.  Not reliable in the least.  Try harder."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I just went to sonic with the taste for their wonderful french fries. When I received my order to my surprise, they had changed their fries. They are not worth the money. They’re processed and airy and hold the oil so they were greasy. I will not be buying french fries from sonic again. Unless they go back to the french fries they had previously."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The drinks are good but, it's expensive to eat here for what you get. The popcorn chicken I bought (overpriced) was old and mostly breaded, not much chicken.Albuquerque, NM. Menaul & Carlisle"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Sonic has either poor or shady management skills. The managers did things like right me up or just take me off the schedule without me even knowing. The manager Blake Ross accused me of not being fast enough or effetiant enough. Even when everyone says I do a good job. On top of slowly being removed from the schedule and not being told anything important. Sonic his either shady, discriminating or have poor management. And he acts like he doesn't know what I'm talking about when I say I don't feel I'm being treated fairly. I've had conversations with my coworkers and nobody else is being treated this way"
sonicdrivein.com,1,I don't recommend sonic to anyone. They don't have staff that makes the food in a quality manner or quantity is inaccurate. Sometimes people are rude and not giving customer service when you arrive. It's not what it seems advertised on TV.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Sonic's employee, an actual manger ignored me then refused to service me about 10 days ago just because she didn't feel like to do it, then Sonic offered me to give a free meal as a compensation, then asked to me download the app, I did as they asked me to, then asked me to wait 24 hours , which I did again. Then they said they have to review it with their team, as if we are dealing with million dollar bank transaction. Really Sonic drive in dropped the ball many times and actually didn't keep their promise. I would not recommend Sonic to nobody."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I ordered a chicken sandwich. It took a few minutes, so I thought, oh good, it will be fresh. The chicken tasted bas as if they had been using the same oil for a long time."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Sonic drive on foxrun parkway in opelika is without a doubt the worst restaurant in the the city they don't wear hair net or a hat or pull their hair up this place is bad no gloves and they are rude my first and last visit I'm talking sweatpants crop shirts and all
sonicdrivein.com,1,Sonic in Tracy no bueno :(Been to this location 3 times and Every time food has been overcookedTook kids there for lunch and food ( chicken slinger and corn dog) was burnt on the outside and not cooked on the inside:(3 strikes & your out*Turn Down Your Oil… Way Toooo Hott*
sonicdrivein.com,1,Had to go through the line twice just to get someone to take our order. Food was just ok. We got corn dogs and they were cold in the middle.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Do not order from this restaurant, The manager Hailey is nasty and rude. She fires employees for no reason not giving them a chance. When asked the reason why she said: I don't have to tell you anything'. Not realizing her tone and actions just lost a potential customer."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Out of the hundreds of apps on my iPhone, the Sonic app is by far the worst app. I am constantly having to log back into the app when I never logged out to begin with ;moreover the app never works. As of today, it has not worked for about eight straight days"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"2 burgers, 2 tots, $20! Ridiculous. Never again"
sonicdrivein.com,2,First time user if the app. All the ordering went fine. Go to the store I ordered from and half of the parking spots were closed because of damage. Notified them I was there and the menu said food is on its way to your car. 15 minutes later I hit the call button and she said she had t make the food. What is the use of the app when you set up a time well in advance to pick it up and it's still not ready.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Tonight I placed an order for two sandwiches in Dyersburg Tennessee. I could see through the front doors the food was placed on a table inside the entry area. Several people walked past the food, they were dancing near the food while talking and laughing.  I am guessing this went on for over 7 minutes until one lady jerked up the bag then started walking towards me. I expressed my disappointment on lack of service for me as a customer. The time this took place was between 9 and 9:30 pm March 12th 2024."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Very disappointed with sonic discontinuing the Snickers Sonic Blast, now I have no reason to go."
sonicdrivein.com,1,My My son got 2 go cheese. they're both overcrooked. My order was messed up. Then didnt get my second hamburger. So how to get my credit card again? Cause they didn't charge for 2 the  the first time.  When it came it was the wrong hamburger. I just took and ate it anyway. Not too happy with this place at all. Preston road frisco texasBesides the second hamburger it took forever. And it was supposed to be expedited
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Just tried the new pulled pork bbq sandwich at Sonic. Flavors are good. Sauce may be a little spicy for some. I was really disappointed in how little actual pork was on the sandwich. When I opened the bun the pork was not visible under the pickles. I purchased two, both were the same. While the price point is good I’d rather pay a buck or two more and get sandwich with more pork than pickles and sauce. I live in the Richmond, VA area. Expectations for a pulled pork sandwich are a lot higher here. Maybe Sonic could offer a double meat upgrade for about a dollar. I’d go for it."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Hate the new app. Not user friendly for people on the go
sonicdrivein.com,1,We ordered and sat and waited for 15min. It said our food was coming out. 5min later we walked up to the door and they said they hadn't even started on our meal. So we had them refund us. The people working there need to clean up. I'm glad they didn't get to touch my food
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Apparently one must itemize their entire order; even when they were VERY SPECIFIC about the order that had to be repeated THREE times only to have it completely FUBAR when it’s finally delivered.  Fries are less than half full and stale, even though I asked for marinara all THREE times I had to repeat my order I still got NONE!! When speaking with the “manager” a refund is apparently NOT an option (much like any actual customer service). The food is mediocre even for fast food, the service is a bad joke, and the general experience is akin to a going to the DMV with a stomach ache. Now nearly TWO WEEKS and FOUR calls to the corporate line, I get a call back from a “manager” who tells me that because it’s been so long, a refund can’t be issued per policy. Funny how now we want to stand on policy when serving garbage food with comically poor service was acceptable. The staff are useless at best and the management hold less value than the half-assed food and abhorrent service. Do the right thing sonic, issue a refund for your failure. Might want to remember that without customers, you don’t exist!!"
sonicdrivein.com,2,I cannot get into the app I have tried like five times. They decided to log me out I've tried to get back into it I used the old password I tried to get a new one it will not let me on the app I miss the good deals you get. They have always treated me with respect until tonight because I thought I was home and even if I am homework I should still not be treated with disrespect cuz I thought I had no money. I received a text on my phone for $1 grilled cheese sandwiches I asked for two I could not order it to the app. They charged me normal price they did not give me the deal I have been a lot of money at this time I never had any problems in the past would be app until they logged me out and I always gave a tip when I ordered through the app. I was tired $4 and something and should have been only charged $2 and something. This happened at the Pinellas Park Sonic off of 49th Street I still get messages from them through text messaging and my email
sonicdrivein.com,4,I loved there chili cheese dogs they were so good i loved them so much I would give them 5 stars but they forgot a chili dog so i took away 1 star
sonicdrivein.com,1,After a long journey inland to taste this holywater I was horrified to find it was not in fact ocean water and when i questioned where the source of their water was from the cashier backed away slowly. The seabourn-men will not forget this hearsay.
sonicdrivein.com,1,They are selling some falsety of our holy liquid. (Seawater) Their Ocean water is a Herasy against the Seabourne.The ocean will remember this Indepth Sacralage
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The last four times that I've been to this Sonic Drive-In, I have waited for my food for over 30 min.  I arrived yesterday at 6:54pm and received my food at 7:26pm.  If I hadn't already paid, I would have been gone.  When I followed up they said that they were waiting on fries.  I had 2 orders of fries included in my order.  We watched several cars come after us and go.  It's very frustrating.  In addition, we had a 25 dollar gift card that we weren't allowed to use because our order was over 25.  It was 42.09.  According to them, they can't accept two forms of payment.  So if this is true, I will not be asking for or buying a Sonic gift card again."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Order from Hwy 278 Covington Ga was disgusting.  Both double cheeseburgers were hard, dried out, and so cold none of the cheese melted. None of the condiments ordered were included in the bag.  Not worth the trouble of turning around, but will never return or recommend this location. The drink order was perfect!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,Ordered 3 orders of onion rings.  They were terrible.  All the crust was falling off the onion rings and they were mashed down into the package.  Was disappointed.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Ordered 2 of the $1.99 double cheeseburgers. 1 w/mayo and 1 w/o ketchup. I also ordered 2 med tots. 1 w/ cheese. Neither burgers had lettuce or tomato on them. 1 w/o ketchup was on 2 bottom buns. I only received the tots w) cheese. I normally don't patronize the location on Frayser-Raleigh Rd. I was thoroughly disappointed.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Went through drive thru window, told to pull up on Thanksgiving Day at 18:06 and they didn’t have the Double Cheeseburger meal to us until 18:37."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Someone in a different state hacked my app and bought themselves food on my dime. Sonic customer assistant refused to help. Would not recommend.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I dont like the new app.  It gives you more chances of sending the order to a wrong location. There is no favorite list for locations.  When you try to select a previous order, be careful or it will send your order to that same location.  Previous version was easier to use & would tell you if you were close to the location you were wanting.  Not happy😠"
sonicdrivein.com,1,They put ketchup on my footlong coney and asked for mustard and oniins.onions. I specifically told them to put mustard and onions on it.
sonicdrivein.com,2,"When I  got my order it contained burnt onion rings and my burger had chips of burnt bacon,the fries were good till I  got to the bottom of the package. I paid 15.00 for a sorry order. So disappointing. This was the Sonic on Frank Avenue  in Lufkin Texas. Of course I  took pictures  for proof."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The app stopped working days ago. This is problematic with this business because the app is how you get half price sodas. Also, I have gift cards attached to the app but no way to use them. My franchise told me to call a support number. They were absolutely worthless. We were overly loyal Sonic fans but that is definitely past tense. I am currently stuck on an order from the 15th and it is not looking like they care. Horrible people answering their phones."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"What happened to my pretzel cheese sauce? I had looked for my pretzel cheese sauce within the bag and it was not there. Mom says, ""Well! That was not fair!"", so now I would have to go home as to find some cheese sauce within the pantry that Mom had bought from Fred Meyers and Safeway.There was even no Lime and no Maraschino Cherry in my drink."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Placed order at the drive thru on 09/26/23 . Had the 1/2 price cheeseburger available after 5 on Tuesdays. So I get up to the intercom and I'm having trouble with the app (me being an older fella ) . So I asked?  If I just ordered it ? Without using the app ? Would I still get the coupon discount ? She responded yes . I added a slushie and and after a slight bit of confusion (me an old dude called it a shake ). That pretty much completed the order . Price came to about ten bucks . Seemed a bit high ?  So , I checked it , on the app while waiting in line . Guess what ? Using the app it came to four and some change. Go figure . So I went on and placed the order . I thought . Then I could go on and explain at the window ? Pulled up and started to tell the guy. Man! He jumped right down my throat .Like he was just waiting . No way this here fella (flexing his bicep) is in any way shape or form (staring down coldly) .About to be bamboozled, by some fast talking so and so, scam man .You see this tough was going to let  old boy here know. What's what ! He proceeded to lay down the law in know uncertain terms . How he had heard my interaction with the young lady on the box . And by golly ( Manuel , I believe ? ) didn't get to be assistant manager here by letting people like me . Pull stuff like this. On the company. No siree bob. Not on his shift . But he exclaimed he was going to fix it even though he heard me order it.And had caught me, red handed. That was like something over $ 4.28 this dude he wipes himself with that kinda pocket change . Well I was so humiliated and also totally embarrassed . I bowed down, and cancelled all my orders .Went away with stomach rumbling . So that's it then .Corporate sent me a free burger coupon .But don't worry ? I sure didn't order it there ! As I was afraid. He might add a little extra flavor ? And I don't mean, a pickle . Think I'm gonna mail him a copy. So he knows he won ..................Too long ?"
sonicdrivein.com,1,Sonic new buffalo chicken bites are garbage. This is the worst sonic crap. There not crispy and nothing on the inside represents chicken. The inside tastes nasty.  Congratulations Sonic on a new low
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I visit Sonic in Coffeyville a lot, or so I did. I usually get my order correct, hot and quickly. Here lately that is not the case. When I have a problem I call Robert, not for free food, I don't even leave my name, I just thought he wanted to know the issues so he has the ability to fix them. That is not the case lately, I have been getting reheated food (rock hard corn dog), burgers not hot and very sloppy made. Tonight I ordered a Corn Dog you're right it was rock hard I had to take off the outside so my granddaughter could eat the rather old hot dog, my burger slightly warm and thrown together so bad I was waring it, it was nasty I managed 2 bites because I was hungry. I'm really disappointed !!! Rob use to care but a phone call does no good anymore."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"It sucks that you have app only deals that the location doesn't honor, and then your app doesn't work. I was told they have no control over the app. Which is probably true, but they could at least honor it. It's not my fault the app doesn't work."
sonicdrivein.com,1,We were at Sonic in Decatur illinois on 9/6/2023 our food order was $17.89 the guy at Sonic ran my card two times said my card was declined ran my boyfriend's card 4 times said his card was declined so our friend let the guy use her card to pay for our food he said it went thru it was paid after we got home cheaked our phones alerts my card was charged two times for sonic my boyfriend's card was charged four times for sonic our friends card was charged once for sonic the money was taken off our cards for all the charges totalling $125.38 when our total bill was only for $17.68 we called sonic on 9/7/2023 the woman said there's nothing they can do about it we called our Banks they are investigating it now we want our money back on our cards we will never go to sonic ever again!!!
sonicdrivein.com,1,They overcharged me by more than $7. I rung up on the app and sent pictures to management. It was like they put everything in separate on the combos. You can get a better crappy hamburger and not get overcharged for it at McDonald’s up the road.
sonicdrivein.com,1,The guy Inside taking orders is rude and the young ladies working outside  really need to touch up some  they all look like they just rolled out of bed.  Only one of the young ladies is friendly and helpful.  I-will not visit a place that is rude and hands me my food as if they are doing me a favor.Please know I am speaking g of the Plano Road location no other. There has to be a hygiene or dress code of some sort at any food place.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"HORRIBLE experience!! Regretfully visited Store 5010, North Platte Ne. drive-thru on Aug.19. After waiting over 30 min. we finally got to the window to get the WRONG order. Upon asking to have the order corrected, the two in the window only wanted to argue and yell at us. After the kid in the window continued to rifle through the food and yell at us, the manager told us to leave. They still had my debit card and when I told them I wanted my card back and a cancelled receipt, they continued to argue. Finally getting my card back and a receipt we left. 15 minutes down the road, I checked my bank account to find out they ran another order and charged my card for items not even on the receipt. After calling the manager, she refused to credit for the fraudulent charge and hung up on me. I have called corporate and YET to get any return call or satisfaction. Word of advice....NEVER, EVER go to one of these dumps."
sonicdrivein.com,1,We waited for an hour and a half for our food and everytime we rang them they just ended the call and we would yell for them and they didn’t respond😡 terrible service DONT EVER GO TO HOBART OKLAHOMA SONIC!!!! You will waste your money and time!!

sonicdrivein.com,1,"While I was at work I recieved an email notification about an order I did not place in a town I do not live. They took my money via my gift card on file in app. I called the store and they had the food waiting and nobody picked it up. They told me to call the number in the app to get a refund. Wow! Those people just kept giving me the run around telling me I had to call my bank to dispute. I again explained it was a gift card, why would I call my bank. He told me there was nothing he could do and to call the gift card number that of course was closed. Do not expect help if you get ripped off. They are useless and do not care. Hope it feels good for this company to rip people off. May seem petty, but I live paycheck to paycheck to support my kids and this is a luxury to them. And now it's been taken from them."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Why? Soft pretzels with cheese packs straight from the freezer. Disgusting! (They said they aren’t allowed to heat them up) eeew
sonicdrivein.com,1,This app steals and there is no recourse to recoup your money --it always the customers fault you forgot a code or it over charges and the store tells you it sall your fault the app overcharged you.
sonicdrivein.com,1,FOR THE LAST FOUR TIMES I HAVE BEEN AT SONIC AND GOT STAWBERRY LIMEAIDE WITH EXTRA STAWBERRIES AND PAID EXTRA FOR THE EXTRA STAWEBERRIES I HAVE GOT LESS THAN I USE TO.  OVER A YEAR AGO BEFORE THE PRICE WENT UP DOUBLE ON ALL THE FOOD. AND I ORDERED CHILI CHEESE FRIES WHICH WAS ON THE MENU AND I GOT CHILI CORN CHIPS THIS HAPPENED TWICE. POOR SERVICE WORSE FOOD! SONIC USE TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO EAT BUT NOT ANYMORE.  YOU SHOULDN'T PAY EMPLOYEES MORE AND HAVE WORST SERVICE. I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT TO DO THE VERY BEST AT MY JOB AND THAT THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. THESE KIDS WORKING NOW DAYS DON'T CARE AND THEY EXPECT PAY OF A PROFESSIONAL! AND WHAT'S BAD IS YOU GIVE IT TO THEM.                             LET THEM START SMALL IN PAY LIKE WE DID FOR SERVING BURGERS THAT WAY YOU CAN GIVE GOOD SERVICE AND LESS PRICE CHARGE TO THE PEOPLE. WE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO  STOP GOING TO PLACES LIKE SONIC.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Oh, no....not again.  I ordered two foot long chili dogs.  Neither one of them had chili.  Had to take them back.  Getting the wrong order happens frequently at Sonic Drive-in on Park Avenue in Greenwood.  Don't stop there."

sonicdrivein.com,1,"Went to Sonic at 616 West Pinhook Road, Lafayette Louisiana, to order a #5 Med Fish Combo for them to give me a dark damn near burnt fish sandwich tater tot’s were the correct color but the grease was nasty on the tots but I thought I was tripping, to bite that sandwich once to check see if it tastes the same but it was worse. I turned around and went back up there for a refund & these people tried to give me $3.81 when I paid $11.27 for the meal including my shake for $2.40. How weird is that for them not changing the grease I have to go through all this! I called corporate they offered me a cheeseburger coupon, as if they didn’t see I ordered fish! Clear to see I don’t want no cheeseburgers! #sad good thing I’m not broke I would’ve been ass out!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"We went to the  Soni in Shelby NC the service was bad as always paid 7.78 for a bacon cheese burger, no bacon on it  so took it back she came out the side door took the half eaten burger inside ( nasty) handed back out the window and slammed the window closed I would not let my husband eat it was scared she may have spit in it he was so disappointed I told him not to go there because I am from Shelby and got food poison from that Soni."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"My hubby and I were hungry for hotdogs so instead of going to grocery, we opted for Sonic.  Long wait but it was busy.  Hot dogs were horrible.  Besides being teeny tiny, the only flavor was the salt that must be dumped in the meat mixture by the barrel. never again"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Store 6917 in Bowling Green KY let me down. The time it took to receive my order was terrible. They weren't busy and it wasn't a huge order that required a lot of cooking. One hotdog, one corn dog, and a small mozzarella sticks(4). After about 40 minutes of waiting I pushed the button again and asked if everything was okay, the response was yes, my orders are behind ""sorry"". Maybe 4 to 5 cars there. I paid with a card and rounded up the change. I think this was the problem. Tip wasn't enough. I usually tip carhops at least $2 but I just didn't have it that day. Tips are optional. People these days seem to have forgotten that. I will never tip another fast food worker again. I was the guy that might come by in a good mood because I had a good week and drop a 20 on you just to spread the good mood I'm in but no more. As a matter of fact I think I am done with fast food altogether.  The service industry has become corrupted by this lazy sense of entitlement. It's just too bad, Sonic was the last of the good burger joints. I forgot to mention I ordered a Reeses blast and they must have fixed it first and let it sit there because it was a melted mess. I had to throw it away."
sonicdrivein.com,2,"I understand the time have change with cost and performances.  However, making a egg and cheese burrito is not hard. Maybe there is a  different cook.  But I like my egg full and fluffy and not flat and fried crispy.  I hope management can direct employees on how food and establishment should be first.  I love eating the burritos there but not anymore."
sonicdrivein.com,1,Terrible  Sonic. Poor management team. Additional customer service training is needed. Soda machine out. Mila wouldn’t refund me for the soda and the GM was standing right there and didn’t offer a resolution. They tried to steal my money. A bunch of crooks. Called customer care and they had the same GM call me. What was she going to do? Erica wouldn’t even address the issue while it was happening and she was standing right there. Mila tried to avoid telling me she couldn’t refund me for the soda. Very deceptive practices going on here. Mila and Erica need to go back to school and learn some customer service skills. Or find new jobs. Shame on Sonic for hiring these 2.
sonicdrivein.com,1,Ordering is okay but you can't select size of drinks- Limeade?  My daughter went to pick it up and I had to call store to tell them she was there because app won't let you check in since my phone was home. Seems very bizarre
sonicdrivein.com,1,I got milkshakes from Sonic spending almost $12 and only ONE of the FOUR milkshakes that i received was the right one. So my money was wasted since i couldn’t drink the wrong ones. I contacted support and all they wanted to give me was $5 credit and a reward for a milkshake. That doesn’t add up to the money that i spent and why would i go back again for them to make a mistake again and waste more time and money. And when i told them that wasn’t enough i haven’t heard back from customer support!
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Ordered a milk shake and 10lb bag of ice.  They  over charged me for the ice 4.29, should have been 2.77 and would not make it right This happened @ white Knoll Sonics Lexington SC. Never Again   Connie"
sonicdrivein.com,2,"I know this is a small thing to most of you, but I just finished buying a corn dog and a sonic drive-in. It was small, the batter was tough in the meat was without flavor. This is not the way it used to be. this just happened wake up Sonic."
sonicdrivein.com,3,The options for extra tomato and extra lettuce on the Sonic app need to be removed.  You will never get extra anything unless you pay for it and you still may not get it.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Don't order on the Sonic App. They will steal your money. If they do not have the item at the store they will not refund your money. Did not have most of my order (including burgers that I ordered). Store told me I'd have to call support. Called support. They offered a $10 gift card, which was less than the amount of food I did not receive. They said they could not issue a refund and had to escalate it to upper management. We will see if anyone reaches out. If not I will be disputing the charge with my credit card. They take your money but don't want to give you the food or your money back. DO NOT ORDER IN THE APP.Update: after reading one of my reviews about what happened. They Said to call them at a different number. I called and they finally gave me a refund. Still a hassle to jump through hoops to get a refund for food I didn't get in the first place bit at least they did process a refund."
sonicdrivein.com,1,When you order something from the menu that’s what you expect to get not what they think you should get.
sonicdrivein.com,2,"Horrible experience- I started off with a takeout order, which mysteriously changed to pick up and when I drove all the way over there, they couldn't find the order. The chicken strips are burnt to a CRISP. I will never order from Sonic again."
sonicdrivein.com,1,"The Sonics in Hudson Oaks and Weatherford Texas do not repair their out of order screens, and do not clearly mark them so a car can see BEFORE pulling in to order. Therefore, you have to pull in and out 2 or 3 times before finding a screen that works! Mark them where your patrons can SEE they are out of order, or put cones in the slot. Hey, or better yet, FIX THEM!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,This is the 3rd time I have been to this drive in and gotten the same problem.  I ordered online and when I got there checked in and waited after a while I asked a hostess about my order and was told it would be out when ready. The screen was already blank and when I asked about it I was told it means nothing. I  waited until12o'clock to get my order that was due 1145
sonicdrivein.com,1,"What went right? Order totally wrong, person on intercom acted totally clueless of their products, talked so low I told them they needed to speak up both sonics in Greenville Ms seem to have a hard time getting orders correct"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I ordered 3 gift cards, unfortunately one was stolen.  I contacted Sonic only to find out the American company has an overseas company handle the gift cards. Ugh.  After several minutes of explaining, I was told a new card would be issued.  After 10 days I contacted them by email and found that it took over a week for them to issue a new card, and that card arrived two weeks after I got the email.  Needless to say, the gift card will not make in time for Christmas.  All of this initially started in early November, so I did plan.  I just didn't plan on dealing with an overseas company.  When I contacted Sonic in Oklahoma, the gal sounded as though she could care less and told me I had to take it up with the company who deals with the cards!  Never again!"
sonicdrivein.com,2,The lady who took was clueless she has a problem specking English very very pushy about selling more even after I told her no I got my burger to bad the lettuce was brown disgusting 🤮 I didn’t pay for brown lettuce I’ll never come to this sonic El Paso tx between Alameda an Carolina 11:40 December 18 2022
sonicdrivein.com,1,Ordered a Large Reese Sonic Blast and it had some crumbles on the top but it didn't have any in the ice cream. It was only the crumbles from off the top in the whole blast. Many many bites had ablsolutley no reese's in the blast. Was almost pure ice cream only. Very disappointing.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"I went To drive-in #6917, which is the newer one on Russellville road, in Bowling Green, KY, on December 10th, and did an app order. When we got the whole order, all of our food was cold. I got a large order of cheese sticks…I went ahead and asked our server for extra marinara…she brought me one extra. When people ask for extra, that doesn’t mean one! We are in the south, at least, give them two or have the server ask how many!!!!!!!! Upon getting home, that one extra, gave us 2 marinara for the whole large order. I had also asked for extra pickles, on my chicken slider and received extra jalapeños! I had 3 pickles on both sliders!! And again, everything was cold! So disappointed in the whole experience!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Got charged 2 different amounts on the same day but only bought food there for 1 of the charges that was on my credit card. I believe I got charged for someone’s else’s order. This isn’t the first time this has happened at Sonic. I will only pay cash in the future, if I ever go back to Sonic. This most likely happens to a lot of people. Beware!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,Just wanted to say how stupid their new commercials are.
sonicdrivein.com,1,I find it sad that sonic is helping to push the nrw world order agenda.Their app will only work if i give up my right to privacy (which i refuse to do) i am intelligent enough to know where i am and capable of entering my city or zip code in order to locate the sonic i want get my order from i do not need sonic to tell me where i am so they can track me.it is only to get you use to giving up your rights to help smooth the path of the new world order that wants to strip you of all your rights.NOT gonna happen here any app that will not allow me to enter the location myself goes bye bye.
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Horrible customer service, the lady that took our order was very rude to us she kept cutting us off while we were trying to order and after we pulled up we found out that it was the manager that took our order! If she doesn’t know how to talk to people and take orders correctly maybe she should not be a manager! I will not be going back to sonic on 105!"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Isnt it a little convenient to advertise 1/2  price drinks on the app, then the app fails to go through and store refuses to honor the half price?? And the date says the 11th of Oct, but its been happening frequently"
sonicdrivein.com,1,"Do not go to Sonic on SMain St in High Point if you want anything to eat. We sat in line for 30 min behind 2 cars. We ordered chili cheese fries only. We get to the window and was told by a young boy as he laid on the counter ""our chili is frozen and you will have to pull over and wait"". We said why could you not have told this to us 30 minutes ago and of course there was no answer. The smell of weed was so strong coming out of the restaurant that I know what the answer was. The back door was open and we almost got a contact high while at the speaker. Something needs to be done about this nasty, unprofessional place that is supposed to be selling food!"
